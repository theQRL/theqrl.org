As always, the length and presentation of these blogs will adjust slightly as the content changes (not all weeks are equally dense in terms of sharable developments).</p><h3>Development Updates</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*g6BbCqnh8GLL-k00cwZwcg.jpeg" /></figure><ul><li>Support for MongoDB Processor in GO-QRL has almost finished, including fork recovery.</li><li>Unit tests for MongoDB have been 80% completed.</li><li>Added <a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/developers/knownIssues/">known issues section</a> to documentation site.</li><li>QuantumFAQ site coming (more on that below)</li></ul><h3>QuantumFAQ site</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7OWx6YmB6TOWSp30ls6DHg.gif" /></figure><p>Those in the community will know the very common responses that come up when speaking to people in the wider cryptocurrency community about Quantum Computing — and maybe they have had these questions themselves.</p><p><a href="https://jackalyst.github.com/quantumfaq/">QuantumFAQ</a> is a site (in alpha) designed as a resource to be linked to and confidently digested with the attention span people have today (seconds). Common responses will be curated underneath to guide people through their curiosities, where all answers should be satisfied in no more than 2 minutes of time. Other thoughts in the future involve more predictive responses and links to more resources.</p><p>The site can be reached at: <a href="https://jackalyst.github.com/quantumfaq/">https://jackalyst.github.com/quantumfaq/</a></p><p>Github repository: <a href="https://github.com/jackalyst/quantumfaq">https://github.com/jackalyst/quantumfaq</a></p><h3>Marketing/Outreach Updates</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/254/1*W0GO5jefz7RKjq84rpaEcw.png" /><figcaption>What a marketing job sometimes feels like</figcaption></figure><p>With the holidays and the start of the new year, we have been hard at work reaching out across the industry to try and spread the good word of QRL. We had an interview this past week that had to be rescheduled, but when it eventually takes place we think it might offer something slightly different from our normal interview fare.</p><p>We were approached by a well-known financial technology publication to give quotes regarding quantum computers. We submitted our quotes, and are hoping to be able to show them off to you in the coming days/weeks as a part of an article they are creating. Stay tuned!</p><h3>Liquidity Update</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*KDYO4etAzPDSLtuktvKeVA.gif" /></figure><p>On March 1st, Coinexchange.io will be delisting the QRL ERC20 token from its markets. CoinExchange never migrated the few ERC20s on its platform, so it is in possession of 0 mainnet Quanta.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1fMKxI33etl-6R2xjHeJDg.png" /><figcaption>Statement on CoinExchange’s delisting page</figcaption></figure><h3>Community Updates</h3><p>As we’ve stated <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-s-in-qrl-december-4th-17th-2018-e7f744845075">previously</a>, we have changed format for the Community Nominations, and will now be conducting them <em>monthly</em>, for a prize of 750 Quanta.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Quantum computing that can break blockchain is coming, and it’s time the blockchain community accepts it — so we can prepare ourselves.</h4><p>The Verge said it best with “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18171732/ibm-quantum-computer-20-qubit-q-system-one-ces-2019">IBM’s new quantum computer is a symbol, not a breakthrough.</a>”. It’s important to expand on that and what it means to Bitcoin, and blockchain in general. What we <em>shouldn’t</em> do is turn a blind eye.</p><h3>Contents</h3><ul><li><a href="#aea9">Primer</a></li><li><a href="#8931">IBM’s Commercial Quantum Computer</a></li><li><a href="#1a57">When do we need to worry, anyway?</a></li><li><a href="#8b16">The importance of preparation</a></li></ul><h3>Primer</h3><p>Anytime there’s an advancement in Quantum Computing, like <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/hardware/intels-49qubit-chip-aims-for-quantum-supremacy">Intel’s 49 qubit chip at <em>last year’s</em> 2018 CES show</a>, or this years CES show with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18171732/ibm-quantum-computer-20-qubit-q-system-one-ces-2019">IBM’s 20 qubit commercial quantum computer</a>, blockchain news outlets are always there to assuage worries, with <strong>“No, [<em>this</em>] Quantum Computer won’t break bitcoin”</strong>, often accompanied by the sentiment that the looming quantum computing threat is being blown right out of proportion.</p><p>What they usually fail to note is that, once again, quantum computing is passing metrics ahead of schedule. Previously quantum computing was relegated to something that would not reach a commercial application until the mid to late-2020s. That is not to say quantum computers have only ever outpaced expectations, but rather to contextualise the strength of today’s quantum computers not just against a static metric of being able to break ECDSA, but also a development curve.</p><p>While it is <em>true </em>that IBM’s commercial quantum computer won&#39;t break Bitcoin, this is <strong>not</strong> the mindset we want to have with the underlying cryptographic fundamentals of something that underpins <em>billions</em> of dollars worth of value (in just cryptocurrency alone)— and hopefully <strong><em>much</em></strong> more in the future.</p><p>To put a visual metaphor to waiting until it’s too late: A ballistic may not penetrate your fortress today, one will someday, <em>a thought secured by recent developments, </em>makes it<em> </em>prudent to fortify sooner and be <em>proactive</em>, rather than <em>reactive</em>. Being <em>reactive</em> means your fortress will be compromised, or in the case of blockchain, your private keys stolen, and what’s the point of fortifying then?</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/498/1*ehnsou-cfieKcYyPi0niDA.gif" /></figure><p>In this way, the frame of the conversation needs be proactive, rather than reactive. Decentralized networks, by their very nature, are censorship resistant, and while that means many wonderful things for end-users generally, in terms of security it means that it can be very difficult/impossible to functionally undo transactions. Therefore, we cannot afford to be <em>reactive</em>, we must be <em>proactive</em> in order to meaningfully prevent negative, irreversible security outcomes.</p><h3>IBM’s Commercial Quantum Computer</h3><p>At CES, <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2019-01-08-IBM-Unveils-Worlds-First-Integrated-Quantum-Computing-System-for-Commercial-Use#assets_115:1612">IBM announced a commercialised version</a> of its 20 qubit computer which could be shipped out to institutions and businesses looking to start building on real quantum computers.</p><h4>How powerful is it?</h4><p>Unlike bits on your computer which are binary and scale linearly, qubits scale exponentially, which means that every qubit added to a system doubles its computational power. For a 20-qubit system, we’re looking at 2²⁰. To give some context, this is something that your average powered notebook can simulate perfectly well and is exactly what Microsoft does for its <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/development-kit">Quantum Development Kit</a>. The breakdown is:</p><ul><li>2²⁰ Laptop: Commercially, we’re here!</li><li>2³⁰ Desktop</li><li>2⁴⁰ Cloud compute service (For Microsoft, this is Azure)</li></ul><h4>If it’s not so powerful yet, who is it for?</h4><p>IBM’s commercial quantum computer is demonstration that they can produce a <em>reliable</em>, upgrade-able commercial quantum computer. Clients who purchase a 20-qubit system today, could upgrade their systems down the line, having already familiarised themselves with IBM’s commercial quantum computer. This would appeal to researchers in particular, as having a QC on-hand would increase uptime for experiments, and help decrease system downtime.</p><h4>What does this mean for blockchain</h4><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18171732/ibm-quantum-computer-20-qubit-q-system-one-ces-2019">As aptly penned by The Verge</a>, this is a symbolic development to mean that NISQ era quantum computers are here, commercialised, <em>today</em>, and with <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/press-kits/quantum-computing/">Intel</a>, <a href="https://www.research.ibm.com/ibm-q/">IBM</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/quantum/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://ai.google/research/teams/applied-science/quantum-ai/">Google</a>, <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/tag/quantum-computing/">Intel</a>, <a href="https://www.lockheedmartin.ca/ca/what-we-do/emerging-technologies/quantum-computing.html">Lockheed Martin</a>, <a href="https://www.rigetti.com/">Rigetti</a>, and <a href="https://quantumcomputingreport.com/players/public-companies/">more</a>, all in the ring competing, it’s clearly not <em>just</em> in the lab.</p><p>The blockchain community needs to accept that quantum computers are here, today. While the timeline for when they can threaten blockchain security is uncertain, <em>whether</em> that day will come is no longer a matter of debate. No one wants to see a catastrophic event where large swaths of the cryptocurrency ecosystem is wiped out, but that is sadly a possibility if we do not act in a timely manner.</p><h3>When do we need to worry, anyway?</h3><p>This isn’t an easy thing to answer, but working off of our “how many qubits” list from above we can expand on it and get a number to run Shor’s algorithm.</p><ul><li>2⁵⁰ Average supercomputer: We have already passed this! Currently, the largest stable QC in the world is 2⁷²</li><li>2⁸⁰ Quantum Supremacy: Quantum Computers are faster than the fastest supercomputer with a synthetic test. A milestone Microsoft is anticipating to pass this year.</li><li>2³⁰⁰⁰ Quantum Computers can run Shor’s algorithm: Shor’s can break ECDSA 256 (what Bitcoin uses): <strong>We want to upgrade <em>well</em> before this point.</strong></li></ul><p>Looking back, we can take the development trajectory of the number of qubits a system has had over the last 4 years and attempt to extrapolate:</p><ul><li>2015: 4-qubits</li><li>2016: 9-qubits (IBM)</li><li>2017: 17-qubits (Intel), 50-qubits (IBM)</li><li>2018: 49-qubits (Intel), 72-qubits (Google)</li></ul><p>This indicates a 5.5x/1yr — 18x/4yr increase, or, assuming a similar trajectory, it will be between 2.2 and 5.3 years until we hit 3000 qubits. However, there is more work to do than just stacking up qubits. There is the lingering issue of error-correction, which currently stands as a barrier to proper, accurate calculations. There is also the issue of scaling, which is being addressed in a number of ways, but has not been solved.</p><p>On the other side, Shor’s Algorithm is merely the first quantum algorithm to usher in an interest in quantum computing. There continue to be advances towards breaking Elliptic Curve Cryptography on a variety of levels through newer, more efficient algorithms that can <a href="https://quantumcomputingreport.com/news/zapata-develops-potential-alternative-to-shors-factoring-algorithm-for-nisq-quantum-computers/">run on our non error-corrected quantum computers.</a></p><p>Those are pretty big variables, which is why you’ll see everything from 2 to 30 years before ECDSA P-256 is broken. In some ways this range doesn’t matter, <em>but there’s no question</em> that we want to have everything secure well ahead of it.</p><h3>The importance of preparation</h3><p>If you’ve ever dealt with keeping systems secure in any capacity, it’s important to keep up to date. Generally, this means following Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) notices and other security bulletins, and checking to see the state of your hash functions and cipher suites.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qGNmQ9d_Xw_Tnat1Hs0xDQ.png" /></figure><p>What becomes very evident over time is that not everything lasts forever. You harden your systems, and others find ways to weaken them. The cryptographic methods you used as a kid just aren’t going to cut it today. One signature scheme that’s held out for a <em>remarkably </em>long time is ECDSA.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zwpeoTZ5o9iHdsPgkp6liQ.png" /><figcaption>Looking at the chart, we’re somewhere around “Minor weakness discovered” and “Serious weakness discovered”</figcaption></figure><p>This is the cadence security and cryptography has had for thousands of years since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">Ceasar cipher</a> and continues to have to this day. Some would say it’s echoed in the fabric of nature itself between parasites and hosts.</p><h4>Proactive blockchain design for an adversarial future</h4><p>Proactive security is a core value for The QRL — something we think should be of paramount importance for any network that caries substantial value.</p><p>We are using XMSS as recommended by <a href="https://pqcrypto.org">pqcrypto</a> to secure our accounts and transactions. XMSS gives complete peace of mind from the emerging black swan of quantum computing, with reusable addresses, provable security and minimal security assumptions.</p><p>This is a <em>proactive</em> step against Quantum Computing, but as the cadence goes, it’s important to be proactive against new developments as well, some which may be harder to predict.</p><p>We went to great lengths to <em>also</em> design a foundation that allows for variable key heights and signature space to ensure compatibility with potential new cryptographic schemes that may be developed in the future. Our blockchain includes the possibility to upgrade signature schemes (XMSS, SPHINCS, + future) and through an address format update, support different cryptographic hash functions (SHA2_256, SHAKE_128, SHAKE256 etc). You can read more about on <a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/developers/address/">our documentation</a> site.</p><p>We hope that blogs like these help illuminate some of the complicated relationship between blockchain and quantum computers. We know that we must act as an educator in this space, and are happy to rise to the occasion.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=cc3e178ebff0" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/no-ibms-quantum-computer-won-t-break-bitcoin-but-we-should-be-prepared-for-one-that-can-cc3e178ebff0">No, IBM’s Quantum Computer won’t break Bitcoin, but we should be prepared for one that can.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OGirdELd8Xkc8YjwCbAVOw.png" /></figure><h3>Introduction</h3><p>It has been a little while since our last “Last Week in QRL” blog. So in honour of this being the first blog of 2019, “Happy New Year!”</p><p>Obviously this blog will have closer to just one week’s worth of content in it, despite covering two weeks, as both Christmas (check out our <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/12-days-of-xmass-e787fd958d2c">12 days of XMaSS blog</a>) and New Year’s occurred during those weeks. As always, life in a startup project can be very hectic, and everyone enjoyed the opportunity to be able to spend some quality time with their families, and perhaps reflect upon the past year.</p><p>As we have stated elsewhere, 2018 was obviously a disappointing year across the cryptocurrency market, in terms of price. However, we believe that both within our project, and across the wider blockchain ecosystem, that some very important and meaningful work has been completed this year. 2018 saw QRL go from an ERC20 to a fully-realised, fully-functional blockchain network. The close of 2018 had QRL as a mineable PoW coin, with liquidity secured, robust documentation and API sites, and many exciting features on the horizon. Given where we were at the start of 2018, we cannot help but look at it as a success.</p><p>Hopefully, as time goes on, the overall prices across the blockchain ecosystem begin to more meaningfully reflect the hard work and real progress being made behind the scenes.</p><h3>GO-QRL</h3><p>Go-QRL has been running stable for around a month now running QRL mainnet. While stable, there’s still components required to bring it up to feature parity with the Python implementation — and beyond. Over the holidays, Kaushal continued his perseverance and added a Public API, makefile support, with a new JSON-based backend infrastructure in progress.</p><p>The JSON-based backend will make it easier for people to interact with the API without requiring the setup and maintenance of our wallet daemon, walletd.</p><h3>Block Explorer</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/488/1*v1io_xyLgIhMdT1dkrhdEw.gif" /><figcaption>Dark and Light Theme</figcaption></figure><p>From the outset, we at QRL have recognised that a piece of software is only as good as the user’s ability to utilise it. To that end, we have never stopped making improvements to our UI/UX. The latest of these improvements, adding a dark theme to our wallet and block explorer, have been another step in that process. This was met with much applause, and some disdain from the community lamenting the disappearance of a light theme.</p><p>Based on this feedback, as the above GIF should show, the <a href="https://explorer.theqrl.org/">QRL Block Explorer</a> will soon have a button to toggle the theme from Light to Dark, and vice versa. We believe this will help make our block explorer experience more pleasant and useful.</p><h3>Mobile Wallet Testing</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_1tj04T7JUzIsbu7DvkpQA.png" /></figure><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-s-in-qrl-december-4th-17th-2018-e7f744845075">When we last checked in</a> on our mobile app on iOS and Android, we were finishing up internal testing and getting ready to move on to a first round of testing to a select group in the community.</p><p>We are happy to report that this has taken place, and that the testing so far has been both productive and encouraging. We recognise that a mobile wallet app is an element that, along with the release of our Ledger app, many in our community have been waiting for.</p><p>After some fixes and tweaks take place, we’ll be opening this up to the wider community to test in the next few weeks.</p><h3>Ledger Nano S</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/971/1*JOUTMbvrI1VFrYGMi7E4HQ.png" /></figure><p>Speaking of the Ledger App, we have more news. As we stated in our previous “Last Week” blog, we had a release-candidate version of the Ledger app up on our GitHub.</p><p><strong><em>We can now say that we have entirely completed the Ledger integration, and are now awaiting only a full and thorough review from the Ledger team themselves</em></strong>, before the app should be ready for release. Integrating with quality hardware like that which Ledger produces represents a significant achievement on the part of the development team, and we are all very proud of the hard work and long hours it has taken to get to being on this precipice of its materialisation.</p><p>Scott Donald has studiously put together a tech demonstration on how the wallet and the Ledger Nano S works harmonistically together.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FNL_u9biLy1g%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DNL_u9biLy1g&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FNL_u9biLy1g%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/43eaedbd6040b4e280addd9df5a4279e/href">https://medium.com/media/43eaedbd6040b4e280addd9df5a4279e/href</a></iframe><h4>Ledger Nano X</h4><p>After 1.5 million devices sold, the Ledger team announced the Ledger Nano X, which you can read more about <a href="https://www.ledger.com/pages/ledger-nano-x">here</a>.</p><p>To answer the inevitable question early on as to whether QRL will work on the Ledger Nano X, the answer is the device will work on the QRL wallet, but there’s more work to enable it on the Ledger mobile and desktop apps.

We just need the web integration to be finished, and testing to commence, before we call ledger-qrl-js v1.0.0 ready for a full release. We will probably have a pre-release version of the app up on our GitHub before New Year’s Eve, for those who cannot wait and want to see our Ledger app in action ASAP.</p><p>We know how long many of you in the community have been waiting for this; it is close to being completely ready!</p><h3>Mobile app</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*klBbafDPyPTSXB3pJiULfw.png" /></figure><p>Mobile app is passing internal testing and should be going out to a hand-picked cohort of community members to do the first round of testing soon for iOS and Android users.</p><p>Features include:</p><ul><li>Transferring a wallet from the desktop to mobile through QR hexseed scanning</li><li>PIN security</li><li>Multiple wallets</li><li>Sending to QR Code address</li><li>Receiving with a QR Code address</li><li>Seeing a history of transactions</li></ul><h3>API &amp; documentation</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*awrKfdtjTwDU-KZ6DWYK9A.png" /><figcaption><a href="https://api.theqrl.org/#qrl-api">https://api.theqrl.org/#qrl-api</a></figcaption></figure><p>New updates to gettotalbalance as a request from upbit is in place. Go-client documentation is in process to help facilitate community testing and those to want to run our <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/go-qrl">go-lang QRL node</a>.</p><h3>Cryptoblockcon</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6f9_bfwjzuJMR4kN1C7j8g.png" /></figure><p>Jack Matier and Adam Koltun were at <a href="https://www.cryptoblockcon.com/">CryptoBlockCon</a> in Las Vegas, Nevada this week on the 11th and 12th. You can read more about it on the <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/crypto-block-conference-this-week-1a8f4d1d0cc4">blog penned by Adam Koltun</a>. But to briefly review; this was the 11th conference attended by QRL this year. QRL name recognition much higher than at start of 2018. Presentation was given on the 2nd day of the conference, video can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/G7K5REE152w">here</a>. CBC was our last conference of 2018.</p><h3>QIP-1 (to CNv1 or CNv2, that is the question)</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/750/1*dhlNj5gdbpQ9vexXD-49hg.jpeg" /></figure><p>Consensus of the team is that migration at this point would not be in the best interests of the project at this time. Reasons cited include:</p><ul><li>It would take time out of progress on other aspects of QRL, including PoS/Consensus upgrade.</li><li>Every consensus upgrade involves backwards portability, meaning support for the life of the project.</li><li>Whether or not ASICS help or hinder the security of a network is still a hot topic with no clear consensus in either direction, as far as security is concerned.</li><li>There’s no firm evidence that there are ASICS in the wild, many of the claims surrounding it are conjecture.</li></ul><p>As this was a discussion technical in nature, we didn’t open the vote up to the public,<strong> QIP-1 has therefore been closed</strong>, though not without some amazing (and respectful) discussion on both sides! You can read the discourse <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/pull/2">here</a>. As with all technical matters, should to context meaningfully change we would be open to resuming discussion with the new context in mind.</p><h3>Nominations</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DvAHSmqbjjes08TtT8C3Uw.png" /></figure><p>Nominations will be moved from weekly to monthly events with an increased award from 250 Quanta to 750 Quanta. This will be started immediately with the first award being announced by the end of January, 2019.</p><p>However, to wrap up the last two weeks of our Community Nominations we have discord users qrl_dude and Cryptographic for their contributions, insight, and thoughts.</p><h3>Explorer dark mode</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*B3AdBDdKJ3_Y1PGAKYCYjA.png" /></figure><p>JP Lomas has been at work putting together a dark mode to the QRL Explorer, which is currently being implemented and test in devnet, let us know what you think. To note, dark mode would be a <em>new</em> mode and not something available by toggling.</p><p>In addition to this, there will be a select few json methods available in the future available via REST (and curl) requests for easily parsing of data.</p><h3><strong>Bittrex</strong></h3><p>In case it was missed, Bittrex has finished it’s migration of QRL ERC20 tokens to QRL’s mainnet Quanta. This establishes proper liquidity for the QRL ecosystem.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=e7f744845075" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-s-in-qrl-december-4th-17th-2018-e7f744845075">Last week(s) in QRL: December 4th — 17th, 2018</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>TL;DR — Was in Las Vegas last week with Jack for the Crypto Blockchain Conference</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6iCdt_MWNmIeO4eN1Ai3GQ.png" /></figure><h3>Met Jack!</h3><p>Last week, Jack and I attended <a href="https://www.cryptoblockcon.com/">CryptoBlockCon</a>. This was my first time working in person with Jack (bringing my total number of QRL team members met to 8, only a few more to go!), and I have to say, while Canadians are supposed to be polite, it is always more impressive in person.</p><h3>Blockchain In The Wider World</h3><p>The event was held at the <a href="https://www.mandalaybay.com/en.html">Mandalay Bay</a> Resort and Casino. In addition to CBC, the <a href="http://www.milb.com/milb/events/winter_meetings/y2018/agenda_events.jsp">MLB Winter Meetings</a>, and a <a href="https://www.nfrexperience.com/">National Finals Rodeo</a> competition was being held nearby, so many of the competitors were staying at Mandalay Bay. Certainly, literal cowboys, baseball executives and blockchain enthusiasts rubbing shoulders made for some interesting juxtapositions. As much as those of us within the industry can sometimes get weary of terms like “adoption” or “mainstream” or “awareness” — moments like these serve as an eloquent reminder, to me, that blockchain/cryptocurrency are still completely unknown to large swaths of American society, at least. It’s useful, I find, to sometimes recognize that for all the drama this space can sometimes produce, that in the long-run, these are minor speedbumps that will be hardly (if at all) remembered by the vast majority of crypto users within the next 10 years.</p><h3>Spreading The Word</h3><p>On the first day of the conference, I sat for an interview with <a href="https://coinstructive.com/category/lab-radio/">LAB Radio</a>, of <a href="https://coinstructive.com/">Coinstructive Consulting</a>. The interview went very well, though at the end of it we discovered that the camera had filled up its memory card part-way through. However, I believe all the audio was salvaged, so it is possible that interview will come out as audio-only. We will tweet out the link to that interview when it is available to us. It was an enjoyable interview, and I am very happy it was not entirely sacrificed to the gods of technological variance.</p><p>Met some individuals who are attempting to help inform the blockchain community more accurately and easily, something in sore need of in this space. <a href="https://blockchainweekly.net/">Blockchain Weekly</a> is, as the name implies, a weekly newsletter delivering various blockchain and cryptocurrency related links, videos, and articles. I cannot wait until there is true, comprehensive coverage of this industry in a reliable and accurate manner. Or at least until there is sufficient competition as to make that a plausible situation. As is, mediocre outlets with no interest in follow-up or fact-checking dominate the space, and sow confusion with every inaccuracy they publish, or quasi-accuracy they fail to properly vet.</p><h3>Made An Impression</h3><p>Over the past year, my speaking times, circumstances, and indeed my presentation itself has shifted and mutated as needed. This time, my speaking slot was at the very end of the last day of the conference. Now, while it might be nice to close out a music festival, functionally closing out a conference is a different matter altogether. After a few long days inside an at-times labyrinthine building like the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino (which was made more confusing by 3 separate conferences all being held inside it at once), people are tired. To be blunt; speaking first or last on the last day of a conference can be tough — people are tired, they may have already seen many of the booths available, and the disinterest is sometimes real.</p><p>Which is why I was so pleasantly surprised that, after my presentation was over, I was excitedly approached by a professor from a university in America who was interested in potentially collaborating with us, or at the very least exchanging information in a hopefully mutually beneficial way. I am leaving this description purposefully vague at this time as we are not sure what this potential relationship may or may not blossom in to.</p><p>If you would like to view a video of my presentation at CBC, here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/G7K5REE152w">link </a>to it on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZl6N10P9LNpYkrMwWYtK1w">YouTube page.</a></p><h3>Looking Forward</h3><p>CBC was our last conference of the year. It was also our 11th. I had the opportunity and pleasure of attending 10 of them (only one I missed was the Crypto Valley Conference), and can honestly say that while they were not all created equal, they all brought slightly different visions of what a blockchain/cryptocurrency conference could/should be.</p><p>To review, our 2018 appearances were:</p><ul><li><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/event-blockdelhi-conference-february-21st-3a15fe318302">BlockDelhi 2018</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/apac-blockchain-conference-2018-3817679b45b">APAC Blockchain 2018</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/global-blockchain-expo-2018-next-week-77afb5a9c61c">Global Blockchain Expo 2018</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/reflecting-on-dc-finances-high-tech-family-office-meetings-b7fe8067d40d">DC Finance’s New York High Tech Family Office Meeting</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/consensus-conference-next-week-63f206bd0641">Consensus 2018</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/reflecting-on-my-evening-with-the-financial-services-club-in-london-573d5713f001">Financial Services Club of London</a></li><li>Crypto Valley Conference 2018</li><li>New York FinTech Week</li><li>Voice of Blockchain 2018</li><li><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/discover-blockchains-conference-next-week-dab6e0b8651b">Discover Blockchains</a></li><li>CryptoBlockCon Las Vegas</li></ul><h3>One Final Note</h3><p>One of the highlights of my conference tour in 2018 were those rare and precious moments when I got to interact with community members. These were all informal (mostly in the context of a bar/pub) meetups; we shared a drink (or two), and got to talk and get to know one another. Meeting the people that use QRL always fills me with a sense of optimism and opportunity. I know that this protocol, and its ecosystem, will continue to blossom in 2019, as it has in 2018.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=2f039b4b6f8d" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/reflecting-on-cbc-2018-2f039b4b6f8d">Reflecting on CBC 2018</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The traveling event serves to showcase companies who are using blockchain, educate current and future industry participants on blockchain technology, and serve as a platform for industry participants to network with one another.</p><h3>Where</h3><p><a href="https://www.mandalaybay.com/en.html">Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino,</a> Las Vegas</p><h3>When</h3><p>December 11–12, 2018</p><h3>Why</h3><p>When we were approached with the opportunity to present at CBC 2018, we had to consider the various factors that make a given conference appearance worth it or not. We had to consider travel distance, the length and prominence of our presentation slot, what we would be presenting, and of course, weigh that against overall cost, both in time and money. When we looked at all of these factors, it made sense to seize this opportunity, and try to maximize it.</p><p>As always, if you will be in Las Vegas this week, whether you are there for the conference or not, and would like to meet up with us, please do not hesitate to reach out. It is always tons of fun to meet users and community members out in the real world. Barring an unforeseen event, this will be our last conference of 2018 — so this will be your last, best chance to see us in person before next year.</p><p>To review, our 2018 appearances were:</p><ul><li><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/event-blockdelhi-conference-february-21st-3a15fe318302">BlockDelhi 2018</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/apac-blockchain-conference-2018-3817679b45b">APAC Blockchain 2018</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/global-blockchain-expo-2018-next-week-77afb5a9c61c">Global Blockchain Expo 2018</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/reflecting-on-dc-finances-high-tech-family-office-meetings-b7fe8067d40d">DC Finance’s New York High Tech Family Office Meeting</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/consensus-conference-next-week-63f206bd0641">Consensus 2018</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/reflecting-on-my-evening-with-the-financial-services-club-in-london-573d5713f001">Financial Services Club of London</a></li><li>Crypto Valley Conference 2018</li><li>New York FinTech Week</li><li>Voice of Blockchain 2018</li><li><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/discover-blockchains-conference-next-week-dab6e0b8651b">Discover Blockchains</a></li><li>CryptoBlockCon Las Vegas</li></ul><p>We are all looking forward to an even more productive 2019!</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=1a8f4d1d0cc4" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/crypto-block-conference-this-week-1a8f4d1d0cc4">Crypto Block Conference This Week!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6bheEm5gsDX00SkHRzBssw.png" /></figure><h3>Introduction</h3><p>We are going to be putting out these “Last Week in QRL” blogs moving forward. Because of the intended regularity of these posts (we will sincerely try to post them around the same day each week, excepting holidays), their length/depth will necessarily vary, sometimes radically.</p><p>Obviously, these blogs should not be taken as being indicative or representative of the entirety of our activities — as with the recent Bittrex migration announcement (which was in the works for months) there are sometimes very exciting developments that we cannot speak on in real-time (due to an NDA or other controlling variable). Additionally, sometimes the language employed in these blogs will be necessarily vague regarding the specifics of what is going on.</p><p>However, we hope that these blogs will serve as a useful and enjoyable insight into what is going on at The Quantum Resistant Ledger. So without further ado, here is what has been going on this past week.</p><h3>Team Updates</h3><p>Elliott has moved on to a new and exciting opportunity, and we wish him the best in his new endeavors.</p><h3>Development Updates</h3><p>We are excited to bring you more images from the continuing development of the QRL mobile wallet (Thanks again Adem!)</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NMBtNCfJHNtohDtxkznHuw.png" /><figcaption>Mobile Wallet UI</figcaption></figure><p>As you have probably noticed, we now have QR (as in matrix barcode) codes in the upcoming build of the mobile wallet! Enabling users a variety of ways to access and control their funds has always been a guiding star for us, and we are happy to be able to take a step further along that trajectory.</p><h3>Marketing Updates</h3><p>Adam and Jack will be heading to Las Vegas December 11th and 12th for the <a href="https://www.cryptoblockcon.com/">Crypto Block Conference</a>.</p><p>Adam <a href="https://www.cryptoblockcon.com/speaker/adam-koltun/">will be speaking</a> there on the 12th, and if you are interested in attending, <a href="https://www.cryptoblockcon.com/register-now/">tickets are available</a>. There will be a preview blog going into further detail closer to the event.</p><h3>Community Updates</h3><p>Our <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/community-nominations-bc4a1f5d5995">community nominations</a> are now live, and have been for the past few weeks.</p><p>Our first community nomination winner was Discord user Doney, for their written contributions.</p><p>Statement from Doney on how he came to the QRL</p><blockquote>I heard about QRL when a friend of mine introduced me to blockchain and crypto. I started reading about blockchain and doing some research on crypto and eventually invested in a few projects. I was looking for unique projects, low market cap, a bit more risk, but higher possible profits. QRL since then became one of the favorite projects for me. So I started to read more and more about the subject. I like to test my opinions and fresh knowledge on reddit. I mean, post something there and you’ll be sure it gets blown to pieces if possible. Talking on reddit about quantum computers and the possible threat for blockchain, always guarantees fireworks, but info from the QRL team and community on slack and now discord has never been proven to be wrong so far. So I really like the technical side of the project and the people involved. The concept of QRL has materialized into a real, technically strong project. I really like the continuing technical development and the extra functionality that is added after launch, and I have a lot of faith in the developers and how they will continue to extend QRL.</blockquote><p>Our second community nomination winner was Discord user snannerb, for their artistic contributions. Snannerb has also created a <a href="https://discord.gg/VFFWbzq">QRL Community Art Discord Server</a> where you can see and contribute artwork about or involving QRL.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*EOfaVw_OZ_6_JlUmCZqhyw.png" /><figcaption>Image created by snannerb</figcaption></figure><p>Statement from snannerb on how he came to the QRL</p><blockquote>It was January 2018 that I learned about the QRL , basically because it was holding its value while the rest of the market was folding. Eventually QRL would follow the rest of the market but after learning about this project I knew I had found what I had been looking for. I had bounced around from project to project since the summer of 2017, and something about QRL just stuck, I love the story of QRL, it really belongs in a comic book or something. I am not the most technical person but it is easy to see that the world is only becoming more digital and the safekeeping of data is to me why QRL is so important. I want to use this technology for what its purpose is, and I love the long term approach of this team, and the great community of folks who keep the knowledge and insight flowing.</blockquote><p>Our most recent community nomination winner is Discord user dr_gonzo, whose positive and productive contributions earned them this week’s community nomination.</p><p>Statement from dr_gonzo regarding the QRL</p><blockquote>I became acquainted with QRL in the depths of the r/ethtrader subreddit in early 2017, where I stumbled upon a link Peter posted to his whitepaper. I had previously read a book about the progression of encryption throughout history, and in that book there was a description of the principles behind RSA. The authors noted that it was the hardest challenge yet for would-be code breakers, but that on a long enough timeline there would likely be a quantum computer capable of cracking our public-key infrastructure. I am excited for more people to learn about QRL as quantum computing news continues to accelerate.</blockquote><p>Remember, to nominate someone, head over to the main QRL <a href="https://discord.gg/V5ZDUAr">Discord</a>, channel #butler</p><h3>Other Updates</h3><p>Yet Another Reminder That Bittrex Is Migrating All ERC20s at 02:00 UTC on December 5th, 2018 UTC.</p><p><a href="https://bittrex.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001472046-Support-for-the-Quantum-Resistant-Ledger-QRL-blockchain-upgrade">Bittrex Announcement</a> Regarding Migration of QRL ERC20s</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=565a24965ed4" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-nov-26-dec-3-565a24965ed4">Last Week in QRL: Nov 26-Dec 3</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>
