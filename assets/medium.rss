            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>TL;DR — The QRL Ledger app has been fully approved and launched. You can download, install, and run the application on Ledger Nano S or X today!</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PqEllAcBIH74HXMBt_1dVQ.jpeg" /></figure><h3>How Do I Use It?</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/805/1*aBt1eqQKWOoHj0ykDC-C_A.jpeg" /></figure><p>As excited as we are to have the application finally launched, we are even more excited for people to actually download, install, and use it on their Ledger devices. The easiest way to do that is to go to <a href="https://www.ledger.com/pages/ledger-live">Ledger Live</a>, download it, and then select QRL’s application from the available options. If you would like a more detailed explanation, we have a separate, dedicated <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/ledger-nano-s-or-x-simple-instructions-49d864c570a5">How To blog</a>.</p><h3>A Developmental Triumph</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xHVUe2hQ5ZhY6xJo3vaOrw.jpeg" /></figure><p>Given the uniqueness of our signature scheme (XMSS), we at QRL could not imitate or attempt to replicate any other project’s Ledger application. As has often been the case, our developers had to design a specific solution that fit the unique needs of our blockchain. While I am not the right person to pen an in-depth explanation of what went into that (though someone else may well do that in a later blog), I would be remiss to neglect to mention their tireless efforts.</p><h3>Auto Migration Post-Ledger Integration</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/429/1*rbHJPM08b8gP0PSYSOVJ0Q.png" /></figure><p>As we have indicated previously, we have been holding off on announcing an exact date for the closing of the auto-migration portal, waiting on Ledger integration. As a reminder, even after the auto-migration portal is closed, users will still be able to migrate their un-burnt ERC20s to main network Quanta. The process will simply no longer be automatic. Details on when exactly the auto-migration portal will be closed, and what the new system will look like, will be in an upcoming blog. The date announcement will also be echoed throughout our social media channels, with regularly scheduled reminders leading up to the day the portal closes.</p><h3>What This Means For QRL</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/200/1*XZt6vF_VdysWmnja_kE0qQ.png" /></figure><p>As we have discussed in previous blogs, Ledger integration has been an important milestone for the project — Ledger is the most used hardware wallet in the space, as well as the leader in hardware wallet technology. It is an important milestone for the community — one of the most dedicated and vocal segments of our user base are Ledger users. We have long heard their calls, and are very happy we can now provide them with the solution to storing Quanta on their Ledger Nano S or X.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=3a8323d2de8f" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/ledger-app-launched-3a8323d2de8f">Ledger App Launched!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Ledger Nano: Installation Instructions</h3><p>There’s a full instructional video coming, and extensive full text-instructions with pictures already on our <a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/wallet/ledger-nano-s/">documentation site</a>, but for those that want the TL;DR of installing QRL on your ledger device, this is for you.</p><p>If you already have setup Ledger Live before and are all updated, you will want to skip straight to <a href="#8897">step 3</a>.</p><h3>Setup and installation</h3><h4>1. Install Ledger Live</h4><p>The easiest way to install QRL on your ledger device is through <a href="https://www.ledger.com/pages/ledger-live">Ledger Live</a>. If you already have Ledger Live, ensure you install the latest firmware update.</p><h4>2. Setup your Ledger device</h4><p>If you’ve already done so, you can skip to step 3, otherwise follow the instructions on the <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006395233-Take-your-first-steps">Ledger documentation website: first-steps</a></p><h4>3. Connect and unlock your Ledger device</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1004/1*W0hwfGE48qRyj3HhOhzZqg.jpeg" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1002/1*iqEVtF3xss5rYjdr1LX4hw.jpeg" /></figure><h4>4. Go to Manager and search for QRL</h4><p>After you have connected your device, search for QRL in the manager and click install. Follow any prompts.</p><p><em>Note: Ledger Live just enables easy installation of the QRL app on your ledger device, you will not be able to add or manage your QRL account from there.</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1006/1*sjp6Kuu4pwc_O2QOiC8Igg.jpeg" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*5utJw10OXSHcyUbgaGRz2w.jpeg" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1003/1*NVGxWmIGu26-0dSML6pFHA.jpeg" /></figure><h4>5. Initialising the QRL App</h4><p>Open the QRL app on your ledger device and scroll down to where it says <strong>Init Device</strong> and press <em>both buttons</em>. This will generate 256 keys (note: be patient, this takes about half an hour). After you are done, your device will be say <strong>QRL READY rem:256. </strong><a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/wallet/ledger-nano-s/#initialising-the-qrl-app">More details</a></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1Ebyx6JDkUMEBEwHsuA7OQ.jpeg" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uaDbR9jU7mK885ExJRVHbw.jpeg" /></figure><h3>Using your device</h3><h4>1. Make sure your device is unlocked (you don’t need Ledger Live for this) and the QRL app is open to “QRL READY”</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uaDbR9jU7mK885ExJRVHbw.jpeg" /></figure><h4>2. Open the webwallet in explorer and Goto open wallet</h4><p>Direct link <a href="https://wallet.theqrl.org/open">here</a>.</p><h4>3. Select from the dropdown “Ledger Nano S” or “Ledger Nano X” and click “Open Ledger Nano S” or “Open Ledger Nano X”</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AP8Q-OWvVR1fBan6NEXnEw.jpeg" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FAzPqyA1XH9qeKn-04Bblw.jpeg" /></figure><h4>4. Done</h4><p>Congratulations, you have successfully installed the QRL app and connected it to the wallet for secure transfers!</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*y_hv2WnQeh9TKADA1QKT7A.jpeg" /></figure><p>For a usage demonstration when it’s connected, Scott Donald has created a video which can be seen below</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FNL_u9biLy1g%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DNL_u9biLy1g&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FNL_u9biLy1g%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=d04bfffea46d4aeda930ec88cc64b87c&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/43eaedbd6040b4e280addd9df5a4279e/href">https://medium.com/media/43eaedbd6040b4e280addd9df5a4279e/href</a></iframe><h3>Extra</h3><p>As a reminder, this is just a brief overview, if you want more information you can always head over to our extensive documentation page on the <a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/wallet/ledger-nano-s/">Ledger Nano</a> or ask any questions you may have on <a href="https://reddit.com/r/QRL">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/QRLedger">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://discord.gg/jBT6BEp">Discord</a>, or email <a href="mailto:support@theqrl.org">support@theqrl.org</a>.</p><p>For those that are a bit more patient, we also have a video in the works covering this process.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=49d864c570a5" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/ledger-nano-s-or-x-simple-instructions-49d864c570a5">Ledger Nano S or X: Simple Instructions</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

We have been looking at/editing the footage from DeveloperWeek, as well as scheduling (and rescheduling) some potential upcoming appearances/interviews on podcasts/web shows. The best of the rest is below.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LrlifOiMRjhMoJzVQcUZMQ.jpeg" /></figure><ul><li><strong>Go-QRL: </strong>Added missing code to remove unconfirmed txn from collection</li><li><strong>Offline Wallet:</strong> Checksum and PGP signing complete</li><li><strong>Ledger: </strong>Ledger asked for a small UX change in BOLOS app which has been implemented</li><li><strong>Mobile: </strong>Crash on Android under investigation</li></ul><h3>Website Refresh</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WcQRBqA9rWucyCwRvLXgkw.png" /></figure><p>As many of you have probably already noticed, we have pushed some light updates to the <a href="https://theqrl.org/">QRL website</a>. These include new categories for the content on the website, as well as changing what was our Roadmap page to the <a href="https://theqrl.org/protocol-updates/">Protocol Updates</a> page. There are also new pages for QIP review, such as the <a href="https://theqrl.org/qip/Multi-Signature-Wallet/">Multi-Signature Wallet</a> page. You can now review any QIP directly on the website (though comments are still done on GitHub).</p><h3>Community</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*188skQSflu5UIWG54FHUHQ.png" /></figure><p>We are happy to announce that Discord user PQAdvantage is February’s QRL Community Nomination Winner! We asked PQAdvantage to tell us a bit about how they came to QRL:</p><blockquote>In 2017, I had discussions with several cybersecurity industry leaders who raised serious concerns about the imminent threat of quantum computing technology to cryptocurrencies and cryptography in general. While I was well acquainted with all things quantum and crypto, the alarm bells had not gone off in my head until those discussions. I spent several months researching the best projects and concluded that QRL surpassed the field by a considerable margin (hat tip to Doney and other great minds in the QRL community for helping me expedite that process).</blockquote><blockquote>Indeed, QRL is exactly what I was looking for as a hedge against the inherent quantum vulnerabilities of the rest of my crypto portfolio. I am astounded by how much the QRL team has achieved to date and excited to see where they go in the future. I believe they are nicely positioned to become quite literally the most secure and reliable post-quantum blockchain platform in the world. I’m also floored by the depth and breadth of the QRL community and learn something new from them every day. In closing, if ECDSA isn’t cracked by the end of 2020, I’ll eat my own qubit</blockquote><p>As a reminder, if there is a member of the QRL community that you would like to put up for the QRL Community Nomination, please nominate them in Discord in the channel #butler.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=7d1a7ff00bfc" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-feb-26-jan-4-7d1a7ff00bfc">Last Week in QRL Feb 26 — Jan 4</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>What happened at QRL the past week</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2eNwEKRe-3XWv7ZNEm7tgw.png" /></figure><h3>Introduction</h3><p>Adam and James just got back from DeveloperWeek 2019 at the end of last week. This blog will be less brief than we thought it might be, as there is the pleasant surprise of QIP 5 to introduce to everyone. At QRL, we are continuing to perfect existing systems and features, as well as continuing to develop new ones. Below is some of what has been going on the past week.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CiW9ZgDwdARVD_76LwNENw.jpeg" /></figure><ul><li><strong>Python Node: </strong>Node with pagination running in devnet</li><li><strong>Python Node: </strong>Address state updated to support multisig</li><li><strong>GoQRL/MongoDB/Explorer: </strong>Explorer being largely refactored (practically rewritten) to take advantage of the rapid speed and reduce node overhead</li><li><strong>Node development: </strong>Go to become primary node implementation in the long term</li></ul><h3>DeveloperWeek 2019</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*XN3dz5ajWVr1xNjmFX8tUA.png" /></figure><p>I will be brief here since we also have our <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/reflecting-on-developerweek-2019-b539dc30a146">Reflecting on DeveloperWeek blog</a>. DeveloperWeek 2019 was a success; it was an eminently professional setup, the presentation went well, and it was a massive event that seemed to work like a well-oiled machine.</p><p>After spending so much time in our own particular niche of the wider technical world, it was both refreshing and inspiring to see how much progress is being made in other areas of technology like Artificial Intelligence, and Virtual Reality.</p><h3>QIP 5: Extending Message transaction Functionality</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/639/1*TJxmqR3MCHUak_0ezgjz3w.jpeg" /></figure><p>Another week, another <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips">QRL Improvement Protocol (QIP)</a>. The newest QIP on the block(chain) is <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/blob/master/2.Proposals/1.%20Open/5%20extended%20message%20format.md">QIP 5: Extending Message tx Functionality</a>. As always, we highly encourage everyone to go read the QIPs in full for themselves. Here is the abstract:</p><blockquote>Message transactions sent on the QRL blockchain network allow broadcast and decentralised storage of 80 bytes of data per transaction for purposes such as notarisation and data stamping. This minor QIP extends the message transaction format to include an optional payee/receipt address.</blockquote><p>We are very excited at the potential of the QIP system, and are very heartened by the QIPs we have seen so far. Whether a given QIP is ultimately integrated or not, we believe that the discussions they inspire are helpful for the growth of the QRL network. Without properly discussing both the necessary next steps, as well as the paths not taken, we cannot be sure that QRL will continue to be the best decentralized blockchain network that it can be. As always, we <em>highly </em>encourage anyone with interest to submit a QIP. It remains one of the most direct ways to contribute to the overall QRL ecosystem, as well as a way to make your desires regarding the continued development of QRL known.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=647f2ab91a14" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-feb-18-25-2019-647f2ab91a14">Last Week in QRL Feb 19–25, 2019</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>TL;DR — Spoke at and attended DeveloperWeek 2019 in Oakland with James</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uqyvUN3A2YYFeX5N8FlPLg.jpeg" /></figure><h3>Setting the Scene</h3><p>This past week, James and I attended <a href="https://www.developerweek.com/">DeveloperWeek 2019</a> in Oakland, California. It was held at the <a href="http://www.oaklandconventioncenter.com/">Oakland Convention Center</a>, located near downtown Oakland. DeveloperWeek is a massive conference, expo, hackathon, and hiring expo that spans 5 days and attracts over 8,000 attendees. To say that it was massive is an understatement.</p><p>In my time at QRL I have only been to one conference that matched the intensity and scale of DeveloperWeek — Consensus 2018. However, while Consensus was massive, it was still an undertaking that was focused on blockchain and cryptocurrency. DeveloperWeek is relatively more broad. In no particular order, DeveloperWeek 2019 had tracks focused on <a href="https://www.developerweek.com/conference/conference-schedule/">VR/AR</a>, <a href="https://www.developerweek.com/conference/popular-programming-languages-frameworks/">popular coding languages</a>, <a href="https://www.developerweek.com/conference/next-generation-languages/">next generation coding languages</a>, <a href="https://www.developerweek.com/conference/the-future-of-developer-tools/">future of development tools</a>, <a href="https://www.developerweek.com/conference/new-database-technologies/">new database technologies</a>, <a href="https://www.developerweek.com/conference/blockchain-development/.">blockchain</a>, <a href="https://www.developerweek.com/conference/artificial-intelligence-dev-conference/">AI</a>, <a href="https://www.developerweek.com/conference/apis-microservices-track/">APIs</a>, and <a href="https://www.developerweek.com/conference/javascript-conference/">JavaScript</a>, among others. As compared to the niche of blockchain/cryptocurrency, DeveloperWeek covers quite a wide scope of topics.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*XN3dz5ajWVr1xNjmFX8tUA.png" /></figure><h3>A New Standard</h3><p>DeveloperWeek was not only one of the largest conferences I have had the opportunity to attend in my role at QRL — it was easily the most professional and pleasant set up I have interacted with as a speaker. Once on stage, it is all up to the presenter, but there is much that can help put someone in a position to succeed before they step on stage. Things like regular communication in the weeks/months before the event, clearly marking all locations at the event, having dedicated A/V managers for each stage, standardized presentation format to reduce visual irregularities, presentation rooms with good/neutral acoustics, and last (but certainly not least) — keeping everything on schedule so that people know where they need to be, when they need to be. I am happy to report that in all of these areas DeveloperWeek excelled.</p><p>In the 10 or so presentations I have given on behalf of QRL, I have seen a wide variety of setup and execution. DeveloperWeek is now the conference that I can hold up as the gold standard of front and back-end logistics. Given that it was also the longest presentation I have given, for one of the larger audiences, it made the experience that much more pleasant that it was handled so professionally.</p><h3>The Presentation</h3><p>My presentation at DeveloperWeek 2019 was titled, “Quantum Computing and the Blockchain/Cryptocurrency Community.” I was given 50 minutes to present (35–45 minute presentation + 5–15 minute Q&amp;A), which was more than we are usually given (most conferences we have 20–30 minutes total). While anyone would appreciate extra time to explain things, given what a complex topic quantum computing is, especially at DeveloperWeek, the extra time was valued. That is because I had the opportunity to present to what was probably the most technically literate audience I’ve had access to. This was not only evidenced in the rapt attention and looks of comprehension I saw on the faces on various audience members, but in the quality of questions I received, both during the Q&amp;A section, as well as after my talk had concluded.</p><p>One such question that I want to highlight here came from a gentlemen who inquired about the open-source nature of QRL (that is to say, whether or not we were open-source). He wanted to make sure that if we were developing solutions, that people would be able to access them, and potentially learn from them. As a reminder, QRL is and will continue to be under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT Open Source License</a>. Blockchain would not be here today if it was not for the open source development community, and QRL remains steadfast in its commitment to giving back to that community, as well as helping to propagate it through the use of the MIT License and thorough documentation.</p><p>In addition, James was able to capture a video of my presentation that we plan on editing (potentially into smaller, bite-sized videos), and putting up on our YouTube page (which will be linked to Medium and elsewhere). Stay tuned!</p><h3>Final Thoughts</h3><p>In terms of conferences, 2019 has certainly started off on a high note. While our 2019 schedule is still taking shape, it is unlikely, for a number of reasons, that we will match the sheer intensity of the conference schedule we had in 2018. We want to make fewer appearances and have a greater impact.</p><p>While we did not end up having a formal supporter meetup due to logistic issues, informally I ran into some people who either were aware of, or had directly used the QRL network. I do not think I will ever tire of those experiences.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=b539dc30a146" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/reflecting-on-developerweek-2019-b539dc30a146">Reflecting on DeveloperWeek 2019</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Next week’s “Last Week in QRL” blog will likely be brief, as there will be a typical “Reflections” blog on DeveloperWeek out as well. We are starting off our conference attendance with a bang in 2019, as DeveloperWeek’s attendance will likely eclipse even that of Consensus last year, as well as covering a broader scope.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HwoygmrZ0lqp9nBbUmjyLg.jpeg" /></figure><ul><li><strong>Offline Wallet Generator: </strong>fix: long-style v-on and v-bind</li><li><strong>Mobile Wallet:</strong> v1.0.8 update</li><li><strong>Mobile Wallet:</strong> Wallet creation test using Appium</li><li><strong>Mobile Wallet:</strong> Simple end-to-end test using Detox</li><li><strong>API:</strong> Adding Explorer API Documentation</li></ul><h3>QIP 4: Multi-Signature Wallet</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Z_ZjOpYV4iiy7ik3JM0Lvw.jpeg" /></figure><p>For those of you unfamiliar, our <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips">QRL Improvement Protocol (QIP)</a> is the vehicle through which we hope to drive much of the serious discussion around specific feature development. To review, some of the first QIPs were regarding <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/tree/master/2.Proposals/1.%20Open/1%20Cryptonote%20v8">Cryptonight V8</a> and <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/tree/master/2.Proposals/1.%20Open/2%20-%20MessageTransaction%20Encoded%20Message%20Standard">A standard message encoding format to indicate encoded data</a>. They live over on our <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips">GitHub</a> and we encourage members of the community to comment, create and discuss them there.</p><p>The most recent QIP is <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/blob/master/2.Proposals/1.%20Open/4%20Multi-signature%20wallet.md">QIP4: Multi-Signature Wallets</a> — if you feel inclined to read it yourself, we highly encourage it! As the QIP states, multi-signature wallets, “allow multiple authorities to have a transaction from a single wallet once consent has been established.”</p><p>Generally speaking, multi-signature wallets allow for more complex uses of a wallet. One such example would be a team within a company, with 5 people, where 3 of the 5 needed to approve any expenditure for a given project. With a multi-signature wallet, they could ensure that in order for funds to be spent, 3 of the 5 signatures associated with the wallet would need to be employed.</p><h3>Upcoming Conference</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*XN3dz5ajWVr1xNjmFX8tUA.png" /></figure><p>Adam and James will be heading out to Oakland tomorrow to present at and attend DeveloperWeek 2019. You can see a preview of what Adam will be presenting <a href="https://developerweek2019.sched.com/speaker/adam_koltun.1yz9ak9c">here</a>.

As always, we will have a reflections blog following the conference.

Developer technology, from blockchain and artificial intelligence to big data and quantum computing represents fundamental innovation that people can build on for years. We are in the DevTech Age, where developer technologies and tools are now the most disruptive and fundamental technology innovation in the marketplace.</p><h3>Where</h3><p><a href="http://www.oaklandconventioncenter.com/">Oakland Convention Center</a>, Oakland, California</p><h3>When</h3><p>February 20–24th, 2019</p><h3>Why</h3><p>When we were approached with the opportunity to present at DeveloperWeek 2019, we immediately realized that this was an opportunity worth taking. DeveloperWeek is one of (if not the) premiere development-centric events in the United States each year, and 2019 is no exception. While we have spoken to audiences that skewed more technical before, we have not had a chance to speak to a crowd like the one we will probably have at DeveloperWeek.</p><p>It’s location in Oakland obviously situates it in the middle of Silicon Valley, the area with the densest location of tech companies, innovation, and development in America. Additionally, we have been granted a longer-than-average speaking slot, as compared to other conferences we have attended (usually presentations are 20–30 minutes, we have 50 at DeveloperWeek).</p><p>Finally, due to a host of factors across the industry and within our own project, we are going to be more selective about which conferences/events we attend in 2019. We have certainly set the bar high with DeveloperWeek as our first outing of the year.</p><h3>Supporter Meetup</h3><p>Due to the tightness of our schedules and the scale of the response we received, we will not be having an official supporter meetup while we are in Oakland. However, if you are going to be at the actual conference, feel free to message us on Twitter or Discord and we may be able to meet up and say Hi, time allowing.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=8992e1c38434" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/developerweek-2019-this-week-8992e1c38434">DeveloperWeek 2019 this week!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

We will have a “Last Week in QRL” blog like normal on the 18th, then Adam and James will be heading out to Oakland the following morning.

As we continue to move into 2019, we will continue to provide these regularly scheduled updates, as well as other updates for specific events.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2G80AfvYyqpjO-1pMfyRhg.png" /></figure><ul><li><strong>API:</strong> Updated address verification documentation</li><li><strong>Ledger: </strong>Adding Ledger Nano S Documentation for QRL App</li><li><strong>Offline Wallet Generator:</strong> Nearing release, new UI/UX (more below)</li><li><strong>Mobile wallet: </strong>Code QA underway, CI/Automated test suite planned</li><li><strong>Website: </strong>Website multilingual support and Polyglot integration in development</li><li><strong>Python node:</strong> OTS bit counter being removed and being replaced with paginated key counter</li><li><strong>MongoDB: </strong>2 hours to sync address state to MongoDB</li></ul><h3>Publicity</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/574/1*5ITCQIlnPRRnEffMSKQT_g.png" /></figure><p>A few weeks ago, we were approached by a writer from The Fintech Times, Matthew Dove. He sent us over a handful of questions related to Quantum Computing and its variable applications, both as a constructive tool, and as a breaker of encrypted systems. You can read more about it in the <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/stepping-outside-our-bubble-the-fintech-times-quantum-leap-4260dec59b4a">blog we wrote on it</a>, or just <a href="https://thefintechtimes.com/quantum-leap-1/">read the article itself</a>. It was exciting to be approached by a publication that is non-endemic to the blockchain industry, and being the only representative of our industry in the article was very fulfilling.</p><h3>Ledger App</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/449/1*aO1bGLiWLcy6CGs2aHGgBw.png" /></figure><p>Our Ledger app is now complete (pending full release from Ledger)! It can now be found (along with installation instructions) at the <a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/wallet/ledger-nano-s/">QRL Documentation</a> site. As always, DO NOT USE THIS APP ON A LEDGER WITH ACTUAL FUNDS IN ITS CURRENT STATE.</p><p>There is no penalty to waiting for the full release of the Ledger app. However, we have received word from some within the community that they wanted to test out the application (again, NOT ON A LEDGER WITH ACTUAL FUNDS), so we decided to provide the opportunity, for those interested and able.</p><h3>Offline Wallet Generator</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/919/1*5pndiSPltfzFki7t16wWbA.png" /></figure><p>As we discussed in our previous <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-jan-22-jan-28-2019-23cfdbb15e18">Last Week in QRL blog</a> — a great deal of progress has been made in the development of the QRL Offline Wallet Generator. We are happy to show off the above screenshot of the UI (as with anything, subject to change) of our Offline Wallet Generator. Being able to generate one’s own wallet, on one’s own machine, with no connection to the internet required, achieves both greater security and greater variety for our users.</p><p>At QRL we are always working towards giving the greatest diversity of reasonable options to our users, and we are happy to see this additional element coming to fruition. If you would like to follow along with the development progress more closely, you can watch the <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/offline-wallet-generator">relevant GitHub repo</a> at your leisure.</p><h3>Community</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*d65j1PcQVrdBPTyMTinCPQ.png" /></figure><p>We are happy to announce that Discord user Cingulate is January’s QRL Community Award Winner! Cingulate has been a constructive member of the community for awhile now, and has also been very helpful in our community insider’s group in advancing meaningful discussions and providing useful insights.</p><p>We asked Cingulate how they became acquainted with The Quantum Resistant Ledger, “I heard someone mention quantum computing in relation to crypto last October, and then did my own research, and found QRL. The rest is history. Came for the unique use-case, stayed for the intelligent and engaging community.”</p><h3>Facebook</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7DDT7zIuqNylApVQGUOhwg.png" /><figcaption>Our new Facebook page</figcaption></figure><p>As most of you are aware, our central community hubs are Discord and Reddit. Discord is where the most lively and consistent conversations happen, and Reddit is where an avenue where conversations that take place over greater periods of time can sometimes be easier to have.</p><p>Our Facebook page has never been the center of our social media strategy, but it is a component nonetheless. We have recently updated our Facebook page, and are happy to show it off now. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/The-Quantum-Resistant-Ledger-492163101309701/">Link to the page</a></p><h3>Looking Forward</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/326/1*VKaWpkExV_9rzvzQ1PBJlg.png" /></figure><p>As many of you have already noticed, there is a new addition to the footer of theqrl.org — The QRL Foundation! From the outset, this project has had the goal of setting up a foundation to handle all manner of things in a responsible and effective manner. More info to come on this (in the form of a dedicated blog), but since we already have it up on the website, we figured we would illuminate the reason as to why (with, again, more details to come later). Those details may be a few months in the making, as there is a basic probationary period in Switzerland for these things, but make no mistake, when we can be more verbose on the subject, we will be.</p><p>We are always happy to check off a box that is still with us from 2017, and at this point, there are precious few remaining.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=93abe4d5a886" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-january-29-february-4-2019-93abe4d5a886">Last Week in QRL January 29 — February 4 2019</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>TL;DR — We were approached a few weeks ago by </em><a href="https://thefintechtimes.com/"><em>The Fintech Times</em></a><em> writer Matthew Dove, who asked us for our opinions on a number of Quantum Computing related issues. We provided quotes, some of which made it into today’s cover story for TFT, </em><a href="https://thefintechtimes.com/quantum-leap-1/"><em>“Quantum Leap”</em></a></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/574/1*5ITCQIlnPRRnEffMSKQT_g.png" /></figure><p>At QRL, we pride ourselves on two things, primarily; our work ethic, and our ability to collaborate effectively as a team. Increasingly, our ability to act as an ambassador and advocate for not just blockchain technology, but also, for lack of a better term, for greater quantum computing awareness, has made that list. We have been approached in the past for quotes on various blockchain and quantum computing related issues. Some of these end up in articles, including, recently, being asked by BlockTribune.com to give some <a href="https://blocktribune.com/blockchain-and-cryptocurrency-predictions-vol-ix/">predictions for blockchain in 2019</a>.</p><p>However, we have never found ourselves being asked to contribute to an article that stretches as far out of our little niche of blockchain (and into a larger niche, that of fintech), while still addressing what the fundamental relationship between network technologies and quantum computers is likely to be in the near future, and what we need to do to prepare for it.</p><p>We are humbled to have been the only blockchain project represented in the article, and we feel that we represented our point of view well; not engaging in fear-mongering, nor dismissing the very real disruptive potential of this emerging technology.</p><p>We recognize that as the first fully functional blockchain network secured by a quantum-resistant signature scheme, we have to both act as trailblazer, representative, and advocate if we are to help raise the awareness of the inevitability of quantum computing, and all that must be done now to protect our future networks from it.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=4260dec59b4a" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/stepping-outside-our-bubble-the-fintech-times-quantum-leap-4260dec59b4a">Stepping Outside Our Bubble: The Fintech Times’ “Quantum Leap”</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>
