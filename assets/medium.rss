This will be announced after a period of time in which we determine everything to be <em>secure &amp; </em><strong><em>well-tested — so stay tuned.</em></strong></p><p>Being well-tested t is something <strong>you can help with</strong> to move things further along. <strong>We’re looking for people to roll up their sleeves and test out the new features on testnet.</strong></p><p>Break things (on testnet) and let us know by creating an issue on <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/">github</a>.

The testnet for Bromine, our first hard fork since the launch of the QRL mainnet, is now live! There is an entire blog dedicated to engaging with testnet <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/bromine-testnet-is-live-9bef2bd71ea">here</a>. In the world of Quantum Computing, IBM has been <a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/ibm-blockchain-cloud-revenue-jerry-cuomo/572037/">betting big on quantum cloud services</a>, and <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/02/26/d-wave-announces-leap-2-its-cloud-service-for-quantum-computing-applications/">D-Wave is getting into the cloud space</a> by announcing <a href="https://www.dwavesys.com/take-leap">Leap 2</a>, a cloud service that allows users to access a D-Wave 2000Q quantum computer.</p><p>After delaying the codefreeze initially scheduled for the 10th, we froze our code on February 21st, a new testnet was released on February 29th, and a test hard fork will occur at block height 10500, roughly the 7th of March. A release date for the actual hard fork will be announced once that is successfully completed. If there are issues, testnet will continue to run test hard forks until everything is stable. As always, we are committed to security and stability above all other concerns.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/468/1*lIx3BPGGfaTrqipEt2N4EA.png" /><figcaption>Credit: Discord user snannerb</figcaption></figure><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrandomx/commit/2da94de739ae722bb074ff22e2728504231807ec"><strong>qrandomx</strong></a>: Fix for pip3 install, by adding deps/RandomX into distribution package</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/integration_tests/commit/e40df2e825dc87579c8d481e320f1a8088dd76c0"><strong>integration_tests</strong></a>: Fixed location of genesis.yml for fork_recovery</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrl-docker-ci/commit/a4bccbc6fe6f5f497a2cafe6d3658601de3c3095"><strong>qrl-docker-ci</strong></a>: Fix yaml in circleci config</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrllib/commit/641ec32e7ff84dc10a07ed0f049321287113e3bc"><strong>qrllib</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Pullrequests/ademcan/master</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrl-cli/commit/262f8eaeb4bcb6ffe8b8c43e640cff966907a3e2"><strong>qrl-cli</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Bump handlebars from 4.1.2 to 4.7.3</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrl-wallet/commit/965a127f35dd90b8a100b9a93a41147bb2300a25"><strong>qrl-wallet</strong></a>: Add pre-HF testnet node hash</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/integration_tests/commit/5769881780c20e6af449d9f18dfed77d53beca40"><strong>integration_tests</strong></a>: Updated docker container to qrl-docker-ci</li></ul><h3>Bromine Hard Fork Testnet is Live!</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*EEvlZLlhfLTo7x8-uVpveA.png" /></figure><p>The Bromine hard fork is the first of its kind on the QRL network since our launch in June of 2018.

This is something that should be expected with any enterprise grade blockchain project.</p><p>With Bromine we’re looking to replicate that, with proper planning and forethought. Ensuring we have all the components (and checklists) in place for a successful migration.</p><p>Part of this has been <strong>documentation and developer support</strong>, some of which has been released already such as the <a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/node/docker/">QRL Docker Node</a>.</p><p>While still in the early stages, the <strong>QRL Docker Node is slated to make launching a node and its related API’s, </strong>whether it’s mainnet <em>or</em> testnet,<strong> a repeatable and reliable process</strong> available on <strong>Windows, Linux </strong>and<strong> OSX</strong>.</p><h3>Project Mercury — Ephemeral Messaging System (EMS) SDK &amp; proof-of-concept code</h3><p>LatticeTX will be available in this upcoming hardfork, and with it comes the ability to <strong>launch your own fully post-quantum secure ephemeral messaging service using our SDK </strong>(Software Development Kit).</p><p>Along with this, one of the much requested components of bringing in developers is more proof of concept code. With that in mind, JP Lomas and Adem Bilican mocked up a <strong>proof-of-concept QRL Ephemeral Chat</strong> using the SDK over the last few days of the summit.</p><p>Code can be found on github: <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/ephemeral-chat-poc">https://github.com/theQRL/ephemeral-chat-poc</a></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/861/1*Mmi4skmxFOX5gpqQIRXVqQ.png" /></figure><p><strong><em>This is still very much a WIP</em></strong>, so when it’s ready to be pulled and played with, we’ll have a separate announcement which highlights different things you can do (hint: it’s not just chat applications).</p><h3>A new foundation Youtube channel</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*oD4GDKw-EVWRdyC2-6Xh4A.png" /></figure><p>Starting fresh in 2020, Michael Strike has, in a phoenix like fashion, and in response to frequent community feedback (potential new trend?), founded a new* QRL youtube channel with a few initial videos and more on the way.</p><p>Already covered are videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0ETCcT3vGY">RandomX</a> (the mining algorithm QRL will be switching to), and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acHQGGuom7s">XMSS OTS key usage and best practices</a> with many more on the way.</p><p>Are there topics you’d like to see covered or are willing to cover/collaborate on?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>QIP 011 — Denomination ideograms for Quanta and Shor</h3><h4>Creative? Have a thought of what the denominations of QRL (Quanta, Shor) should look like? Lets see them!</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OAPFL1PNSbPS6r4oNA392A.png" /></figure><h3>Summary</h3><p>QRL Improvement Proposals (QIPS) can be used for a wide variety of things pertaining to QRL ecosystem which aren’t suited as github issues (which we <em>highly</em> appreciate and look forward to!). Usually, they’re technical in nature but they don’t need to be! This QIP is design related to improve the interaction and integration of QRL into various user facing interfaces and can be seen as an example on the flexibility of the QIP process.</p><p><em>It should be noted</em> that the seeds for this QIP evolved during discussions at our developer meetup in Amsterdam2020 that will still be going on as this blog hits the world wide web! Look forward to more on the fruits of our summit at a later date.</p><p>With that out of the way, for this QIP, <strong>we’re looking for two groups of people</strong>:</p><ol><li>Creatives to design different currency concepts for Quanta and Shor, our two denominations. Please continue reading to the end to better understand submission requirements!</li><li>People from all walks of life to act as private judges to evaluate whether a submission resembles like that of a currency. Interested? Please either message jackalyst on <a href="https://discord.gg/jBT6BEp">discord</a> or through email at jack@theqrl.org.</li></ol><h3>Motivation</h3><p>Ideograms are useful in conveying an idea or concept which is independent of any particular language.</p><p>Doing so as an SVG allows for usage in a wide variety of mediums. Further creating a webfont hosted either locally or from popular third-party services has the added advantage of being able to be easy to implement.</p><h3>Specification</h3><p>The reference asset format should follow the Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG v1.1) standard which has a wide userbase and can be incorporated into a font and hosted either locally and/or on third-party services.</p><p>This will be then compiled into the Web Open Font Format (woff) and Web Open Font Format 2 (woff2) standards.</p><p>In order to qualify whether a prospective ideogram is symbolic as a currency, it should be tested against a diverse background of people from different regions with a positive result being that it’s recognized as a currency.</p><p>For the test, every positive result can be recorded as 1 and negative as 0. These results would then be compiled and an average established with the final resulting floating point value between a 0 and 1. An overall result that’s greater than a value that’s to be determined through discussions will signify whether the ideogram works to represent a currency in a series of short-listing rounds.</p><h3>Backward compatibility</h3><p>Both SVG 1.1 and Woff/Woff2 are open standards and offer wide support.</p><h3>Implementation</h3><ol><li>Quanta and Shor ideograms should be uploaded, <em>separately</em>, as a gist in the SVG format and linked to in a comment as part of the comments-uri thread of this QIP: <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/pull/23">https://github.com/theQRL/qips/pull/23</a></li><li>A diverse team will be elected to do an initial round of testing as specified in the specification portion of this QIP with a process where the submitter of the ideogram wont be identified.</li><li>Ideograms would be short-listed and tested against a wider audience less familiar with QRL and short-listed further.</li><li>A vote would take place to identify favourite currency ideograms</li><li>The selected ideograms would be cleaned up and made into respective woff and woff2 files.</li></ol><h3>Anticipated common questions (ACQ!)</h3><p><strong>What values are Quanta and Shor?</strong></p><p>Quanta represents a whole value of QRL. As of today there’s 70,000,000 Quanta in circulation.</p><p>Shor is 1x10^-9 Quanta (0.000000001) and is the smallest unit of QRL.</p><p><strong>What if I don’t know how to use github, or a … gist?</strong></p><p>Feel free to ask in our support channel in discord for some help and if a team member doesn’t help out, we’re sure a member of the community can assist you. Github (and git) can seem scary, but it wont bite, promise.</p><p><strong>Why upload the ideograms separately? This can hurt consistency between shor / quanta designs</strong></p><p>Unfortunately it would be hard to evaluate whether they fit the criteria outlined above if they’re evaluated together. After proper candidates are chosen, the files will be cleaned up and made to have similar design attributes (ie. line thickness, endings, etc)</p><p><strong>What is the submission deadline?</strong></p><p>The submission deadline will be determined at the discretion of the judges based off of submission frequency and any other factors deemed appropriate. When the deadline is determined there will be a last-call announcement.</p><p>Have an idea yourself that can improve the QRL ecosystem which doesn’t fit as an issue and want to make your own QIP but are too intimidated by the process or not sure if it’s something that would qualify? <em>Please</em> reach out to jackalyst on discord or through email at jack@theqrl.org.</p><p>Also feel free to first hash the thought out with our friendly community as well either on <a href="https://discord.gg/jBT6BEp">discord</a> or <a href="https://reddit.com/r/QRL">reddit</a>.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=917a54478674" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/qip-011-denomination-ideograms-for-quanta-and-shor-917a54478674">QIP 011 — Denomination ideograms for Quanta and Shor</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This marks the first blog in the new monthly format. We have switched to this format to allow for these blogs to contain more information, be more meaningful, and to make it easier to follow along with each and every blog.</p><p>Since our last entry, the holidays have come and gone, and already there has been news on the Quantum Computing front. IBM and Daimler have <a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ibm-daimler-ces-2020-quantum-computer-solid-state-batteries-lithium-sulfur/">announced a partnership</a> to develop new lithium-sulfur batteries using quantum computers, <a href="https://phys.org/news/2020-01-advance-benchmark-quantum.html">new benchmarks for quantum computers</a> have been developed by researchers at the US Department of Energy, and <a href="https://www.eetimes.com/intel-cryogenic-chip-for-quantum-computing/">Intel has developed a new type of hardware chip</a> for quantum computers called Horse Ridge. 2020 has barely begun, and already it is looking like it will be a big year for quantum computing.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*z_DehZcA2vi3DwIPrtehCQ.jpeg" /><figcaption>Credit: Discord user Smith</figcaption></figure><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrandomx/commit/c9cac9e1c5f9d1ce260fc9605dbd4df947ade807">qrandomx</a>: Fix - Process all items on eventQueue to avoid deadlock</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/api.theqrl.org/commit/26111a862f70465c34a8235b8496abacaa988e74">api.theqrl.org</a>: API Patches (New API)</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/block-explorer/pull/331">block-explorer</a>: Use latest explorer-helpers module</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/explorer-helpers/commit/700dd2f29a298368869df50ae3692c30e07d4f5e">explorer-helpers</a>: build(deps): bump handlebars from 4.1.2 to 4.5.3</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrl-cli/commit/6b82388f8c506b4b624e7e9a591f4cf3c8a82784">qrl-cli</a>: feat: Add create-lattice and get-keys functions</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrl-wallet/commit/24aaf86ec33645bbf82b86750e6ac9c38830ed14">qrl-wallet</a>: Fix some UI issues and spend bug</li></ul><h3>Upcoming Amsterdam Dev Summit</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*eK6lo3akAk7DISzNU-CfQw.jpeg" /></figure><p>As many of you are aware, the developers for QRL will be meeting in Amsterdam this week to collaborate in person on the most important technical developments for the QRL network. Being able to work in the same place (to say nothing of the same timezone) can be invaluable to the development process. First in line for this particular summit is the upcoming hard fork — what is will contain (more on that below), implementation, optimization, and testing.</p><p>Look for more announcements regarding the developer summit and all it has accomplished once it has been completed.</p><h3>The Hard Fork</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-nNQCz8N12ry2Zr-hwI-pA.png" /></figure><p>While more information will come out regarding the hard fork on the other side of the developer summit, and as we approach the date of the fork, for now we can give you some of what will be included, as well as some information regarding the timing of the hard fork:</p><p><strong>Dates<br>CODE FREEZE: 10th February </strong><br><strong>RELEASE: 11th February <br>FORK DATE: 25th February — Block height TBA</strong></p><p><strong>Features</strong></p><ul><li>RandomX mining Algorithm</li><li>Multisig addresses &amp; transactions</li><li>LatticeTX (ephemeral messaging stub)</li></ul><p>There will be more information regarding the hard fork as we approach the dates for code freeze and ultimately, the fork itself.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Development Updates, New Interview Released, Changing Format</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*B5iXCEipz86PCVo1g_7MLw.png" /></figure><h3>Introduction</h3><p>As you may have seen in the <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/decentralised-voting-and-trustless-autonomous-hard-forking-269d024f4edb">blog released earlier today</a>, Ephemeral Messaging, Multisignature Wallets, and ledger-wide polls are some of the features that will be included in the next QRL hard-fork. We also have the audio from the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/whatiscrypto/episode-11-how-to-protect-bitcoin-from-quantum-computing-w-adam-koltun">What Is Crypto Podcast </a>(more on that below), and today another video interview was recorded (likely to be released later this month). We will also be slightly changing the format of this blog series moving forward (more on that below as well).</p><h3>Change To The Format Moving Forward</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aWTgDUNZJtFH4s5_8Dn1Ng.jpeg" /></figure><p>When we started this “Last ___ in QRL” blogs, we debated internally whether to make it a weekly or monthly blog. The question was one of whether or not we would have consistent enough content to fill out a weekly blog, as well as whether or not a monthly blog would be too infrequent to give a good sense of progress. We initially decided on a weekly blog, and for the past 54ish weeks that has come in the form of the “Last Week in QRL” blog. While the format has served us at times, ultimately the disparities in content available to us on a weekly basis has made it clear; these blogs will be more consistent, and more useful to the community, if delivered in a monthly manner.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3wTIdKSXxdBWuHvdJiVh_g.png" /><figcaption>Credit: Discord user Smith</figcaption></figure><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/mobile-wallet/commit/6e3f8a90e7c25ab60fdfad7da35160d999db4e79"><strong>mobile-wallet</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Correct hexseed and mnemonic retrieval for iOS advanced wallets</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/block-explorer/pull/329"><strong>block-explorer:</strong></a> Add MS_Vote and Fix UI handling of invalid transactions</li></ul><h3>New Interview Released — What Is Crypto Podcast</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/300/0*JuYyeDdvFPbc64zX" /></figure><p>A few weeks ago I sat down with Michael Nye of the “What Is Crypto” podcast to talk QRL, Quantum Computing, and blockchain in general. The audio is available on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2VdNosP06URJb29IaH3PC3?si=NMKhSxL2R16XHiG1QZbKog">Spotify</a> and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/whatiscrypto/episode-11-how-to-protect-bitcoin-from-quantum-computing-w-adam-koltun">Soundcloud</a> right now. The interview runs about 20 minutes long and is mostly introductory (the podcast is called “What Is Crypto” after all). It is always a pleasant opportunity to introduce new audiences to what QRL is, and why we need quantum resistance in blockchain today.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=b4a34ecb3310" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-11-26-12-2-b4a34ecb3310">Last Week In QRL 11/26–12/2</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2012/3 when I first became obsessed with bitcoin it was obvious to me there were many more applications than value transfer for bitcoin-like systems to improve the world. Chief among these was decentralised voting for use in provably fair and secure political elections. This was long before the QRL existed and even before the consensus related issues around bitcoin and the block-size fiasco.</p><p>Conflicts of interest are inevitable in any ecosystem where value is created, transferred and stored. If we have learnt anything from that period of bitcoin history, it is that decentralised monetary blockchains should be able to adapt in an autonomous manner without relying upon gatekeeping developers who may not share the same goals or viewpoint of the stakeholders (userbase) of that cryptocurrency. Contentious consensus changes may only be introduced in such a system following a specified upgrade path.</p><p>It seems logical that the place where contentious decisions to both network and token functionality should be decided is on-chain — the sole point of truth for everyone.</p><p>(Note: this may not stop the default and easiest position for contentious decisions to be deferred simply continuing the status quo).</p><h3>Roadmap upgrades</h3><p>For some time the core team and community have been debating various system upgrades through our <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips">QIP</a> (QRL Improvement Process). This process on github allows anyone to suggest an improvement to the existing QRL ecosystem to built. There, a safe dialogue between developers and users can occur where technical points of view may be discussed, or the merits of a particular upgrade debated transparently. Such discussion naturally includes only a small component of the community and tends to attract largely technical users and preclude interested but non-technical users. Still it is a crude measuring stick for deciding whether a feature should be actively pursued or set aside.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*72v61d9U1aXuUPPDU0UA-A.png" /></figure><p>The QIP system is a real gem for the QRL but governance of the project can be improved moving forward.</p><h3>On-chain voting</h3><p>The upcoming qrl-core hard fork includes several exciting new features including ephemeral messaging, multisignature wallet capability (built into the webwallet GUI) and an extension of multisig where ledger-wide polls may be held and voted upon by all QRL users with a non-zero balance.</p><p>How does this work? First let’s discuss how our QRL multisig setup works. First in the node or webwallet a new multisig address is created using a <em>MultisigCreateTx </em>In where more than one QRL addresses are added to the address with signatory weighting (think voting rights for each address). Next to move funds a <em>MultiSigSpendTx</em> is created by one of the listed addresses and the value to transfer and destination address(es) are declared. Finally, each signatory may make a <em>MultiSigVoteTx</em> to sign the spend transaction — then once the threshold is reached funds are moved (note: multisig vote and spend are functionally identical). Whilst this sounds complicated it is actually extremely simple using the click-through GUI of the webwallet.</p><h4>So, voting..?</h4><p>To allow ledger-wide voting a ‘magic’ multisig address (‘Q110000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000’ to be precise — and unspendable) is now designated. This address is special because instead of a limited list of specific QRL addresses it has <em>all</em> QRL addresses with a non-zero balance as valid signatories.</p><p>Whilst in the backend they are actually modified multisig functions — to keep things clean there are two newly presented transactions subtypes to be used for voting:</p><ol><li><em>ProposalCreateTx</em></li><li><em>ProposalVoteTx</em></li></ol><p>Any QRL address may create a valid <em>ProposalCreateTx</em> and start a ledger-wide poll. This transaction sets the type of poll (QIP, user, consensus-changing configuration settings, etc) and allows a specific QIP to be designated, with an additional optional descriptive text string supplied, and a block-height expiry.</p><p>To vote upon an existing ledger-wide poll a QRL address simply creates a <em>ProposalVoteTx </em>supplied with the relevant<em> ProposalCreateTx </em>txid and supplies the voting data — support, reject, abstain etc..</p><p>Some of you will have realised that tracking and cataloguing decentralised on-chain polls and votes in the QRL will be easy by simply looking up the magic address on the explorer — with all data piped into readable useful form on the protocol updates page realtime.</p><p>With just the above behaviour it is possible for any QRL user to propose a new QIP and ask the community and stakeholders (coin holders) to objectively vote upon whether it should proceed — no developers or core team required whatsoever — fully decentralised.</p><h3>Self-amending chain behaviour</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/853/1*2y_77DdYw7SRDWqAQYgQkw.jpeg" /></figure><p>The more eagle-eyed will be wondering what ‘consensus-changing configuration settings’ means.</p><p>Once ledger-wide polls and voting is active then this opens up the possibility of creating self-amending behaviour for network consensus rules and behaviour.</p><p>The following parameters are <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/QRL/blob/master/src/qrl/core/config.py">configuration</a> settings in the qrl-core client. If changed they will potentially cause a hard fork and split the network into one or more chains. They may all be potentially ‘amendable’ following implementation of on-chain voting:</p><ol><li>block-time interval</li><li>block-reward</li><li>total emission</li><li>maximum block-size limit</li><li>consensus-changing threshold limit</li><li>block-height poll expiry maximum</li><li>minimum transaction fee</li><li>hard coded peer_list</li><li>re-org limit</li><li>minimum accepted qrl-node version</li><li>consensus algorithm (for a later release!)</li></ol><p>It is possible using the <em>Proposal</em> transaction subtypes to propose a direct network change, and then upon reaching a satisfactory threshold for that on-chain proposal, to autonomously fork in the new consensus settings from the next block. Thus, a poll with a successful vote may alter the parameters of the network in a completely decentralised trustless and autonomous fashion.</p><p>In effect the existing rules of the system are moved onto the chain and may be altered only by ledger-wide voting consensus.</p><h4>Examples</h4><p>An example could be altering the emission curve based upon consensus or making blocks more or less frequent than currently. Another simple change would be to alter the peer_list to amend a new IP address acting as a discovery node for new entrants to the network — say if some of the earliest network nodes were migrating to a new platform. During a network transaction spam attack it may be necessary to implement a temporary minimum transaction fee — this could be done via a voting proposal and direct fork update to raise the minimum transaction fee from zero.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/283/1*QNmylxWA1MG_vmpWqqYM9w.png" /></figure><h4>Future upgrades</h4><p>It is also possible to extend these initial self-amending features to include future code modules to automate a mining algorithm change or other consensus upgrade — for example, migration to POS at a given block-height.</p><p>There is a QIP coming out which will flesh this out in more detail and interested parties will be able to help us test these changes on QRL testnet in the near future.</p><h3>Definitions:</h3><p>Hard fork — a network upgrade which is not backwards compatible to existing clients, with legacy nodes behaving differently if not upgraded, potentially resulting in two versions of the chain going forward.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=269d024f4edb" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/decentralised-voting-and-trustless-autonomous-hard-forking-269d024f4edb">Decentralised voting and trustless autonomous hard forking</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>
