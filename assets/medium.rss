            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>tldr; Ledger progress, mobile improvements, API documentation, our new post-quantum notarisation feature, and a brief update on smart contracts!</em></p><p>We have now surpassed our 44,000th block with no major issues, a testament to the amount of testing done by the development side at QRL. To date, nobody has locked up their funds (to our knowledge) on the QRL blockchain.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/1*x2IMle4WkmTOEXlYzXfBsA.gif" /><figcaption>Post Launch — Team at QRL HQ</figcaption></figure><p>With mainnet out of the way, many of us took alternating breaks, while a few others continued drumming on.</p><h4>Ledger Progress</h4><p>While the main codebase for the Ledger has been completed, there is now webwallet Ledger support for complete end-to-end support. This just needs to be reviewed by the Ledger team for full hardware support.</p><p>You can use the code yourself by heading to the respective repositories below, this comes of course with a caveat emptor (warning), test at your own risk!</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/ledger-qrl-js">theQRL/ledger-qrl-js</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/ledger-qrl">theQRL/ledger-qrl</a></li></ul><h4>Mobile Improvements</h4><p>Both the <a href="https://wallet.theqrl.org">webwallet</a> and the <a href="https://explorer.theqrl.org/">explorer</a> have had some adjustments to make everything work across all platforms, from desktop to mobile.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/413/1*G6DiQ7GQ8Xp2_xqbBNWheQ.gif" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/413/1*l6KaeT00quSag_RDdIYYbw.gif" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/413/1*txJj_moRTFuFlrU6vWrg0Q.gif" /></figure><h4>Post Quantum Resistant Document Notarisation</h4><p>After a successful launch, it’s time to start looking for the future! There will be a more blogs coming, that will go over what is on the horizon. In the meantime, it’s nice to build off of what we already have operational on QRL.</p><p>One of our first new features is Post Quantum Resistant Notarisation! For those that don’t know,<strong> Notarisation </strong>(British spelling)<strong> </strong>is the official fraud-deterrent process that assures the parties of a transaction that a document is authentic, and can be trusted. As you can imagine, this is a big thing in many industries. You can read more at <a href="https://www.nationalnotary.org/knowledge-center/about-notaries/what-is-notarization">national notary</a>.</p><p>You can try notarisation yourself <a href="https://wallet.theqrl.org">here</a> by going to our <a href="https://wallet.theqrl.org">webwallet</a> and selecting ‘Tools -&gt; Notarise Document’.</p><p>Don’t want to go through the whole process of notarising a document?</p><ol><li>Download a test document (<a href="https://cryptome.org/2016/01/CNSA-Suite-and-Quantum-Computing-FAQ.pdf">here</a>)</li><li>Go to the explorer <a href="https://explorer.theqrl.org/tx/9f2b01c3ed74cdeb7d5bffa4ed1b42bae4c2dfd91d15c94aef8f5589f11f711b">here</a>, select the file downloaded in step one, and click ‘Verify Notarisation’.</li></ol><p>There is more to come in this area to make it easier to use. Nice work Scott!</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/540/1*7rhh3NxTQXg4oHHGkgS1rg.gif" /></figure><h4>Smart Contracts</h4><p>There has been some initial work with our smart contracts, which there will be a <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/QIPS/">QIP</a> of soon.</p><p>To avoid any potential compromisation of security we will limit the scope of smart contract code execution, and confine such code to fairly narrow logic statements. You can still do <em>almost </em>anything with such a design, but it makes for a much more secure system.</p><h4>QRL API documentation</h4><p>While we have had <a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/">documentation</a> for various elements of our ecosystem up to this point, James has been hard at work with the API documentation, complete with examples on how to get started. The documentation is now live at <a href="https://api.theqrl.org">api.theqrl.org</a>. This is a major step in facilitating utility that will make it easier for developers, as well as outside organizations that may be interested, to build off our chain.</p><p>Now is the time to get started and head over to the <a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/">qrl documentation site</a>, <a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/node/QRLnode/">run a node</a>, and browse the <a href="https://discord.gg/KAg5fAm">#qrl-app-ideas</a> channel on our <a href="https://discord.gg/KAg5fAm">Discord</a> for ideas — or share one there yourself!</p><h4>Our road ahead</h4><p>As we get some final legal aspects sorted, and our main network coin listed on a known exchange, we have many exciting developments that we cannot wait to share with our users and the wider cryptocurrency community. Stay tuned!</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f6cd800e0a63" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/step-by-step-what-weve-been-up-to-f6cd800e0a63">Step by step, what we’ve been up to</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>TL;DR — Red4Sec finished, more audits coming, and an update regarding mainnet</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*2_UP8IGhmeUbwSiaN6Gecw.png" /></figure><p><a href="https://red4sec.com/en">Red4Sec</a>, our auditor for the last 7 weeks, has completed their audit and submitted their report to QRL. Red4Sec consists of a talented team that has spent much of the past 2 months poring over our code 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. They were joined in parallel by our own team, also scouring our codebase for vulnerabilities and mishaps, as well as dealing with issues raised by Red4Sec as they came up.</p><p>During the analysis, whose report runs over 200 pages, a total of 67 vulnerabilities were detected. Many of these vulnerabilities did not pose any risk by themselves and therefore have been classified as informative.</p><p>All vulnerabilities were classified according to the impact level defined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerability_Scoring_System">CVSS</a> (Common Vulnerability Scoring System): critical, high, medium, low and informative.</p><p>A summary of the issues per project area is described below.</p><h3>What Red4Sec covered</h3><p>Red4Sec’s report was exhaustive, and covered the entirety of our project space, with the exception of our Post Quantum Cryptography, which will be covered by a further audit as it’s more specialized in nature. Below is a rundown of issues raised by Red4Sec by section of our network, as well as impact level.</p><h4>Blockchain</h4><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/QRL">QRL</a> (Python)<br><strong>Critical</strong>: 6 issues identified — All fixed by end of audit<br><strong>High</strong>: 3 issues identified — All fixed by end of audit<br><strong>Medium</strong>: 4 issues identified — 2 fixed by end of audit, outstanding fixes have now been applied (everything is fixed)<br><strong>Low/Informative</strong>: 21 issues or queries which have all been reviewed by the team, with changes made to the codebase where necessary.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qryptonight">Qryptonight</a> (C++)<br><strong>Critical</strong>: 1 issue identified — fixed by end of audit</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrllib">Qrllib</a> (C++)<br><strong>Informative</strong>: 1 issue which was closed by the end of the audit.</li></ul><h4>Public facing Infrastructure</h4><ul><li><a href="https://wallet.theqrl.org">QRL Wallet</a> (JS)<br><strong>Critical</strong>: 1 issue identified — fixed by end of audit<br><strong>High</strong>: 1 issue identified as informative by Red4Sec — the team rated it as High, however, and it was fixed by the end of the audit</li><li><a href="https://explorer.theqrl.org">Block Explorer</a> (JS)<br><strong>Low/Informative</strong>: 1 Low and 1 Informative level issue which were both closed by the end of the audit.</li><li><a href="http://theqrl.org">theqrl.org</a> (JS)<br><strong>Medium</strong>: 1 issue identified — fixed by the end of audit</li></ul><h4>Backend &amp; Team processes</h4><ul><li>Infrastructure includes nodes, cloud services, mail services and any other service that QRL relies upon for development and other team processes.<br><strong>Medium</strong>: 5 issues identified — all fixed by end of audit.<br><strong>Low/Informative</strong>: 11 issues have been identified and all have been fixed.</li></ul><h4>Some words from Red4Sec:</h4><blockquote>In general terms, it has been detected that the design and logic of the project is well defined.</blockquote><blockquote>The project code follows a methodology of safe programming and good practices. The project has great support from the team as some of the vulnerabilities have been resolved at the time they were detected by Red4Sec, mitigating the possible impact and repercussion that could cause to the project.</blockquote><p>The whole QRL team thanks Red4Sec for their professionalism and attention to detail in improving the quality of our ecosystem.</p><h3>More audits</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/256/1*KJ97NABMOdKXiBWnyINcEw.png" /></figure><p>As our codebase and ecosystem grows, it is important to continually appraise the security of our implementations.</p><p>We are, therefore, pleased to announce that we have signed an agreement with <a href="https://www.x41-dsec.de/">X41 D-Sec GmbH</a> to undertake a <em>secondary</em> security audit in the coming months. This audit will be differently focused than the Red4Sec audit, leveraging some of the specific expertise at X41 such as covering the Post Quantum Cryptography portion of QRL.</p><h3>Mainnet Progress Update</h3><p>It has been a long ride to reach our main network, and our launch is just the beginning of the overall QRL journey.</p><p>A date for the launch of the QRL main network has been finalized and will be announced in the coming days.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*wOpNyhey8Kogd6i88dfuoA.jpeg" /><figcaption>QRL On the Horizon — User art by Discord user @snannerb</figcaption></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=563ecfe04c75" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/red4sec-security-audit-concludes-a-summary-563ecfe04c75">Red4Sec security audit concludes; a summary</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been some time since our last general progress update blog. In this blog we will do our best to detail as much as we can regarding:</p><ul><li>The ongoing audit with Red4Sec</li><li>The creation of mobile wallets</li><li>Support for Ledger Nano S</li><li>Token burn update</li><li>Bug bounties</li><li>Transform PR</li><li>Conference/expo/meeting appearance summary</li><li>Mainnet plans</li></ul><p>This will likely be the last general update blog before the announcement of our main network, with smaller updates in the interim.</p><h3>The ongoing audit with Red4Sec</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/200/1*MgE-EIz1eOdKfzR32AW6FA.png" /><figcaption>Red4Sec logo</figcaption></figure><p>In the last week of April, our audit with <a href="https://red4sec.com/en">Red4Sec</a> (henceforth R4S) started, and we are happy to say that progress is steady and we can expect it to complete within the next 2–4 weeks. Over the past month, we have closed every issue on the private GitHub by R4S in a timely manner, as they have been raised. Fortunately, nothing thus far has been what we or Red4Sec would consider a critical vulnerability.</p><p>We are close to signing on our second audit partner, who will have a different focus on our repository than that which R4S is guided by. Mainnet launch will not be delayed for the conclusion of this audit.</p><p>We will have a separate blog discussing the audit once it has concluded. Moreover, we will be announcing information about the second auditor shortly.</p><h3>The creation of mobile wallets</h3><p>Our mobile wallet developer, Adem, has been hard at work (with the help of our designer, Luke Hahn) developing Android and iOS versions of a QRL wallet! We are happy to share some of the preliminary pictures of what the mobile wallets may ultimately look like:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/234/1*nVtplmj0cD-CZoZvcliC2w.gif" /><figcaption>Quick demo (low fps due to Medium filesize limits)</figcaption></figure><p>Due to the early nature of their development, no date can yet be made available regarding when these applications will be available to the general public. It should also be noted that design and UI elements may change between now and when the mobile wallets are launched. However, we can say that the mobile wallet should be operational within a reasonable time frame following the launch of our main network.</p><p>The repository for the iOS and Android version is <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/mobile-wallet">now available</a>.</p><h3><strong>Support for Ledger Nano S </strong>🎉</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/902/1*mQy3h4Xg2YQs_wh_LFrFJg.png" /><figcaption>Ledger generating private keys for a new wallet</figcaption></figure><p>We recognize that many of you have been patiently waiting for an update on this item in particular. Our developers have made great progress towards full Ledger support: we now have full wallet functionality inside a development environment. Due to computational limitations, the device takes about 45 minutes to generate a wallet. However, this only needs to be done once, and it only takes a few seconds to sign a transaction.</p><p>There is still some work to be done in order to make it ready for general consumers, but we cannot overstate the technical feat that has been accomplished here. From the outset, it was clear that it would be a difficult task to achieve functional Ledger support. We are very thankful to Juan for his tireless work in this regard, and to Leon for his invaluable technical advice and consult.</p><p>We will make more information available regarding Ledger support as development moves forward in this area. To be precise, we are at the point in time where the Ledger team is going to be reviewing our code. Pending approval, the code can and will be made available for public use on Ledger Nano S.</p><p>There is now a public repository for <em>some</em> (but not all) of the code related to the Ledger: <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrl-ledger-js">here</a>.</p><h3>Token burn update</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/821/1*or_uwJy9Z14oKco-rOrbxg.png" /></figure><p>The beginning of our token burn process was a big milestone towards the launch of our main network. We are able to provide an update on its progress: ~25% of QRL ERC20 tokens at large have been burned. <strong>If you’ve already burned your tokens, remember to keep track of that wallet file, and back it up on at least two separate devices!</strong> It is the <em>only </em>means by which you will able access your funds on the main network. <em>If you lose this file, the team can do nothing in order to return your funds to you, due to the very nature of blockchain technology. </em>Unlike other blockchains, a large quantum computer will not help you recover your coins on our network.</p><p>If you are reading this and would like to burn your tokens in order to have your wallet credited inside the genesis block, please read our <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/qrl-token-migration-begins-b0d5b53f697f">token migration blog</a>.</p><h3>Bug bounties</h3><p>Some time ago we announced a general plan to implement bug bounties. This was not forgotten. Thus far, we have fleshed out the framework of the program that we intend to use. It is now pending legal review in order to ensure that all participating parties are kept safe. Therefor it is likely that the official bounty program will be in place soon after mainnet launch.</p><h3>Transform PR</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/256/1*zla7a6BKBiIYrAzSc96siQ.png" /><figcaption>Transform Group logo</figcaption></figure><p>We’ve hired a PR agency to help bring our marketing and promotional efforts to a new level. You can read our blog post about it <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/we-hired-a-pr-firm-9ef9c19bb219">here</a>.</p><h3>Conference Appearances and Other Things</h3><p>In case you missed them: here are the <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/reflecting-on-apac-blockchain-2018-1fbba71a50f">APAC</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/reflecting-on-consensus-2018-ef1509897eec">Consensus</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/reflecting-on-blockchain-expo-2018-83055106aae0">Blockchain Expo</a> blogs giving an overview of the various conferences and expos that we attended. Adam is currently in the process of identifying and coordinating conference, expo, and other visits of interest for the second half of 2018.</p><p>In addition, you can read up on the summaries of some of our meetings with <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/reflecting-on-dc-finances-high-tech-family-office-meetings-b7fe8067d40d">DC Finance</a> and the <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/reflecting-on-my-evening-with-the-financial-services-club-in-london-573d5713f001">Financial Services Club</a>. The networking made available to us through these is invaluable, and we are very thankful to have been allowed the privilege of presenting.</p><p>We will have a blog with a full or partial list of conference appearances in a few weeks, as new conferences are still being announced and communicated with.</p><h3>Mainnet plans</h3><p>This section is likely to be the most interesting part of the blog for most people. Now that we are nearing the conclusion of the pre-genesis development effort, our plans for launch can be made more clear.</p><p>One can expect us to launch a few weeks after the R4S audit has completed. On launch, the following will be immediately available within the Quantum Resistant Ledger ecosystem:</p><ul><li>The first fully quantum resistant cryptocurrency on its own main network.</li><li>Agnostic Cryptonight Proof-of-Work mining (<a href="https://getmonero.org/">Monero</a> mining compatible)</li><li>Post-genesis ERC20 QRL-to-mainnet migration tool</li><li>Quantum Resistant Tokens, also on the QRL network.</li><li>The web wallet, for easy interface with the QRL network.</li><li>Node documentation, in order to assist developers in their participation with this open source effort.</li><li>Public, audited node (including related) code available on GitHub</li></ul><p>In the future, after mainnet launch, the following will likely be made available, in no particular order:</p><ul><li>Ledger Nano S support</li><li>Bug bounty program</li><li>Ephemeral messaging layer</li><li>Android and iOS mobile wallets</li><li>Proof of Stake</li></ul><p>Some things that we have in mind for the future:</p><ul><li>Smart contract feasibility evaluation immediately following mainnet</li></ul><p>We understand that many of our supporters would have liked to see some of these features at launch. However, due to time constraints and an acute understanding that a quarter of all tokens at large (and rising) are currently locked into migration, certain non-critical features had to be pushed back.</p><p>Regarding exchange support for our main network: per instruction, we cannot discuss whether or not any given exchange listing our ERC20 token will or will not convert automatically those ERC20 tokens to our mainnet QRL. Please look to those exchanges for notice in regard to these matters.</p><p>We are also in talks with new exchanges about listing our mainnet QRL coin. Exchange support information will be made available as soon as we are free to share it.</p><p>In conclusion: it is reasonable to expect us to launch in the weeks following the conclusion of both the R4S audit and the CryptoValley conference.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=80c7dbe89ac0" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/pre-genesis-project-update-80c7dbe89ac0">Pre-Genesis Project Update</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

TransformPR has been in the blockchain/cryptocurrency space since 2013 and currently its clients represent about 31% of the total cryptocurrency marketcap. The documents were signed last week, and we are happy to say that work is already underway, and a number of exciting placements are coming up in the next few weeks.</p><p>With offices in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Paris, Cape Town, and a global headquarters in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Transform is perfectly situated to help QRL expand globally and maximize the impact of our message.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/528/1*_-MCWYq_Q7-pu7KtssFGng.png" /></figure><p>TransformPR has represented more than 200 companies, organizations and projects in the blockchain space, and has helped more than 80 token crowdsales and scaling campaigns, including Aeternity, Augur, Bancor, Bittrex, Counterparty, Dash, Ethereum, Factom, Golem Network, Gnosis, Kraken, Lisk, Rivetz, SALT Lending, ShapeShift, Storj, Syscoin, and WAX.</p><p>Transform is led by Michael Terpin, Founder and CEO, who has more than 25 years of PR agency management. Michael directly supervised many PR campaigns of the digital media era, including early-stage PR for America Online, Earthlink, Jupiter, Motley Fool, Match.com, and Shapeways, as well as full-service campaigns for AT&amp;T, Fujitsu, JBL, Konami, Marriott, Memorex, Philips, Rackspace, and TEAC.</p><p>We are excited for how Transform will help us reach out into more non-endemic outlets and spaces, as well as help us cut through the noise inside the ever-more-crowded blockchain/cryptocurrency space.</p><p>On a personal note, I am overjoyed to have them on board as it will allow me to focus more on <em>creating</em> content and determining forward-looking strategy, and less time chasing after reporters and outlets trying to <em>place </em>said content. Transform has already lined up a number of placements and interviews, some of the traditional sort, and some of a more colloquial variety (podcast, etc).</p><p>Everyone should look forward to seeing those placements come to light in the next few weeks, and going forward expect a stronger press presence for QRL in all of its endeavors.</p><p>TransformPR — welcome to the team!</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=9ef9c19bb219" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/we-hired-a-pr-firm-9ef9c19bb219">We Hired A PR Firm!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>TL;DR — Flew to London to speak to the Financial Services Club, met many people in unique FinTech positions, figuring out the second half of 2018</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/668/1*-Oqaf4bcxnjSJUtb786ufw.jpeg" /></figure><p>Last week, I had the opportunity to fly to London to give a presentation to The <a href="http://www.fsclub.net/">Financial Services Club</a>. This was made possible by <a href="https://thefinanser.com/">Chris Skinner</a> — author of over a dozen books, including his most recent accomplishment, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Human-Revolution-Humanity-Everyone/dp/9814794376">Digital Human — The Fourth Revolution of Humanity Includes Everyone</a>” which has been well received both critically and commercially. Chris reached out to us on Twitter initially, which then spiraled into a more general conversation that ended with me agreeing to present to a group of FSC members.</p><p>The Financial Services Club bills itself as, “The number ONE networking group for senior executives in financial services in Europe” and has chapters in England, Ireland, Scotland, Poland, Norway, Sweden and Austria. From my experience that night, I can certainly confirm that if one was interested in networking opportunities in the financial services sector, then I would think the assembled talent that I saw would be very appealing indeed.</p><p>I spoke to a selection of FSC members at the historic <a href="https://www.paintershall.co.uk/">Painter’s Hall</a> in London. As an American, it is always impressive to be able to walk through halls that are older than my country, and it was truly pleasant to be able to have a thoughtful, thorough discussion about forward-looking tech in the midst of such storied history.</p><p>Part of the appeal of such gatherings is that there is an element of intimacy and privacy attached to them — as such I will not be divulging any personal details of any of the attendees, and will instead keep things more circumspect as it relates to the members of The Financial Services Club. They were kind enough to invite me into their space, so I will try to respect theirs.</p><p>The evening was structured fairly normally, with a brief informal period for introductions and drinks in an adjacent room, followed by moving into the main hall for the presentation, Questions &amp; Answers, and then moving back to the adjacent room for more conversation and drinking for about an hour. My presentation took a little under an hour, with another half hour or so being used for Q&amp;A.</p><p>Both the host and chair for the evening were extremely gracious in introducing me both to many of the members in attendance, as well as before my presentation. By the quality and quantity of questions and comments following the presentation, I believe it was a success. Certainly, vigorous applause is something one likes to receive at the end of talks. However, while applause is a sign of a good talk, engaged and attentive audience members asking quality questions during the Q&amp;A is the hallmark of a great one. Some questions were more challenging than others, but all that revealed was the amount of knowledge assembled in the room, as well as what active listeners the FSC members were.</p><p>Generally it is a good sign when there is so much post-presentation conversation as to run over the allotted commingling time. I ended up heading to a pub with 4–5 of the attendees after the event, where we continued a more general discussion of Cryptocurrency, Blockchain, and where both are headed for the next few hours over a few rounds of drinks.</p><p>One of the things I have been most fortunate to experience in my time with QRL is such a diversity of audiences for my presentations/talks. The perspectives of blockchain developers, family office managers, exposition hopefuls, conference attendees and in this case of FSC — current and former executives in the financial services industry, some of which had taken a career pivot into the tech sphere.</p><p>I am a firm believer that anyone stuck in an echo chamber loses their sense of perspective. It is always important to remember that one of the strengths of cryptocurrency and blockchain is that these technologies appeal to many different people on many different levels, but it can be easy to lose sight of that.</p><p>Blockchain is not one thing, and it is not even necessarily one thing primarily. Blockchain is many things, to many people, and one of the most important things I have learned in this space is that the only way to learn what it is Blockchain means to all these diverse subsets of people is to go out and meet them, talk with them, and hear their perspectives.</p><p>I can honestly say that my evening in London with the Financial Services Club has been one of the most unique, and interesting, experiences I have had in this space. It provided me with opinions and points of view that I (and I would imagine, most people) do not often hear in person, articulated by people with the knowledge and experience to leave no doubt as to the sincerity of their words.</p><p>Thank you to The Financial Services Club, Thank you to Painter’s Hall, and Thank you to Chris Skinner for making this all possible.</p><h3>Second Half of 2018</h3><p>As I mentioned in my last blog, we at QRL are still figuring out what our conference attendance will look like for the second half of 2018. Got a conference worth attending? Send me an email at adam@theqrl.org.</p><p>We hope to have a preliminary internal list of conferences produced within the next week or so, with outreach occurring immediately afterward. Securing sponsorships and the like can take time, but stay tuned, we should hopefully have that settled in a month or so.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=573d5713f001" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/reflecting-on-my-evening-with-the-financial-services-club-in-london-573d5713f001">Reflecting on my evening with the Financial Services Club in London</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*l38TFB4SRRxe599AIl-bWQ.png" /></figure><p><em>TL;DR — Consensus 2018 overview, our first conference as attendees, how the supporter meetup went, some highlights, and what to expect next</em></p><p>This past week the eyes of the blockchain/cryptocurrency world was on Midtown Manhattan, where more than 8,000 people gathered at the Midtown Hilton to attend Consensus 2018. Due to a last minute change in plans, Peter was not able to attend the conference. In his stead, James Gordon, who handles Documentation for us at QRL, stepped in and quickly booked a flight/hotel for the week. It was great to see James step up and it was also very nice to meet him in person. I have now met more than half of the QRL team, and hopefully by the end of the year I will have met pretty much everyone in person.</p><h3>Seeing a Conference From the Other Side</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/678/1*wedgCtggsC1gUqHL0527pw.png" /><figcaption>Midtown Hilton, location of Consensus 2018</figcaption></figure><p>Up to this point, we at QRL have either presented, exhibited, or done both at our previous conference/expo appearances (<a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/event-blockdelhi-conference-february-21st-3a15fe318302">BlockDelhi</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/reflecting-on-apac-blockchain-2018-1fbba71a50f">APAC</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/reflecting-on-blockchain-expo-2018-83055106aae0">Global Blockchain Expo</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/reflecting-on-dc-finances-high-tech-family-office-meetings-b7fe8067d40d">DCF Family Office Meetings</a>). Consensus was the first time we were going as simple attendees, which gave us different opportunities than we have had previously.</p><p>While nothing can match the pure attention grab of an on-stage presentation, I was able to cover much more ground as an attendee. Unlike when one is presenting, where even if it is only a 15–20 minute talk, you need to be there an hour early usually, with prep time before that. Similarly, while a booth allows for a permanent fixture on the conference floor, it also anchors one or more teammates to it for the duration of the conference. Without it, all 4 team members at Consensus were free to explore as much of the conference as they could. While we would run into one another at certain points throughout the conference, we spent most of our time taking separate paths to cover as much ground as possible.</p><h3>QRL Supporter Meetup at Connolly’s</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5L5Qw6zY8ySuKmi0oyV2aQ.jpeg" /><figcaption>From left to right: James, Michael, Discord user Terria, Juan, Adam</figcaption></figure><p>The QRL supporter meetup at Connolly’s Pub and Restaurant occurred on the first night of the conference and was, by all accounts, a success. Being able to meet some of our users in person, as well as meeting our adviser Robby Dermody in person for the first time were fulfilling and productive experiences.</p><p>We talked about how we each came to the project, the state of cryptocurrency currently, and the unusually good weather in NYC that day (we were supposed to get rain, which did indeed arrive mid-Tuesday, and stayed for the rest of the conference), and what we had each done during the first day of the conference. While we do not always have time to have supporter meetups when we attend conferences, I was thankful that we had time during Consensus, because it turned out to be, for me at least, the most relaxing evening of the week.</p><h3>Day 2 — Clear Skies Until They Weren’t</h3><p>On the second day of the conference, the good weather from Monday held at first, and it looked like we may have gotten away with sidestepping the forecast of rain and thunderstorms. However, while the weather was a bit late, it was every bit as intense as expected. There is perhaps no better example of acute microeconomics than an umbrella salesman in the rain. Seeing some of the half-drenched negotiations going on outside the awning of the Hilton was a great juxtaposition to many of the business deals being conducted inside.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nnuXGAgvAG6HDP8EVatJdQ.jpeg" /><figcaption>The team at lunch on Tuesday — blissfully unaware of the rain mere hours away</figcaption></figure><p>One of the nice things about Consensus was that we were able to have a team lunch on 2 of the 3 days of the conference. This afforded us a rare opportunity to get away from the noise, catch our collective breaths, and refuel a bit, before setting out for the afternoons. It also allowed us to catch up with Michael, as he was busy with work for his daytime employer for much of Consensus.</p><p>On Tuesday there was an NYU graduation event nearby, which left us with a curious mixture of purple-gowned graduates, their families, and crypto folk all jumbled together in a 3 block stretch of Midtown Manhattan. Luckily, there was plenty to do inside the venue itself for those who didn’t want to venture out into the crowded streets.</p><p>While I personally didn’t get to see more than 2 panels over the 3 days (due to how crowded it was I was running late for meetings all conference), but from what I was told by everyone, there were several quality talks given and opinions voiced.</p><h3>Day 3 — The Rain Came Down</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/1*oUvu9MV5_-6eFFUmhEW3zg.jpeg" /><figcaption>The Midtown Hitlon during the downpour</figcaption></figure><p>By the end of Consensus, the weather was as it was predicted to be for the duration of Consensus — cold, rainy, with occasional severe thunderstorm warnings.</p><p>I spent most of the 3rd day of Consensus in various coffee shops and cafe’s within a few block radius of the Hilton, meeting people from various organizations and firms. One of the nice things about Consensus is that, for all the criticism of high ticket prices, over-selling, and diminishing returns, a gathering of that size and density does provide some unique opportunities.</p><p>To give one anecdotal example — after returning from a fairly productive meeting and needing some refreshments, I headed to where they had food put out, and sat down briefly. Got to talking to some of the people at my table, and realized that one of them was part of an organization that could provide a useful collaboration with QRL. The two of us then headed back out, into the rain, to find a quiet cafe to sit and really get into it. Those sorts of moments are much less likely to occur at smaller conferences, and are made more possible by the sheer human density of an event like Consensus.</p><h3>What To Expect Moving Forward</h3><p>Over the next several weeks, in no particular order, the following should occur:</p><ul><li>Announcement of a partial or full list of Q3/Q4 2018 conferences QRL will be attending</li><li>Announcement of second auditing firm</li><li>Expansion of our efforts on the marketing side of the project</li></ul><p>We know that, in cryptocurrency, a day can feel like a week, a week can feel like a year, and waiting for security audits to complete can feel like a lifetime. We thank our users for their continued patience and understanding. We are on the precipice of a great many things, and cannot wait to jump into them together with our community.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ef1509897eec" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/reflecting-on-consensus-2018-ef1509897eec">Reflecting on Consensus 2018</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Details of supporter meetup. Second auditor selection update.</em></p><h3>Who</h3><p>The QRL Delegation at Consensus 2018:</p><ul><li>Peter: Founder</li><li>Adam: Marketing Manager</li><li>Juan: Lead Architect</li><li>Michael: Technical Solution Architect</li></ul><h3>What</h3><p>Consensus 2018, put on by <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/">CoinDesk</a>, is the 4th iteration of the annual blockchain technology summit. This year it is held at the <a href="http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/new-york/new-york-hilton-midtown-NYCNHHH/index.html">New York Hilton Midtown</a>. Consensus 2018 will feature more than 250 speakers, 4,000 attendees, as well as many leaders from financial institutions, academic/policy groups, and investment entities. In addition, there will be enterprise tech leaders, and those who are building the foundations of the blockchain and digital currency economy represented both during the day and in the after-conference events that are planned across NYC for the entire week.</p><h3>Where</h3><p><a href="http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/new-york/new-york-hilton-midtown-NYCNHHH/index.html">New York Hilton Midtown</a>, New York City, New York, USA</p><h3>When</h3><p>May 14–16, 2018</p><h3>Why</h3><p>Simply put, when it occurs, Consensus 2018 will be the largest cryptocurrency event yet seen in North America. Located in the heart of New York City, Consensus not only will provide high-quality content and opportunity for structured networking events, but also act as a draw for blockchain events throughout the week.</p><p>Consensus is a unique event in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space on a number of levels, not the least of which being the sheer size and scope of the event itself. Being able to commingle within such a massive and diverse cross-section of the blockchain/cryptocurrency ecosystem is an opportunity that the QRL team could not pass up. (Adam: On a personal note, it is nice to be able to attend a conference without having to cross an ocean.)</p><h3>Supporter Meetup</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Kjcs3vGcobJMNhmirsS5fg.jpeg" /><figcaption>Connolly’s at 43 W. 54th St, Manhattan</figcaption></figure><p>We thought that we would do a small supporter meetup during Consensus because New York, similar to London, is a city with a massive population of both people and pubs.</p><p>The details of the supporter meetup:</p><ul><li>May 14th</li><li>7pm</li><li>Connolly’s</li><li>Ask for “QRL” or “Adam Koltun” at the door (had to make the reservation under a person’s name, will look into adding QRL to it once we get to NYC)</li><li>Adam will buy anyone wearing QRL gear a beer</li></ul><h3>Second Auditor Selection Update</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/650/1*QGjaua3zN8eAb2L51dqCXw.jpeg" /></figure><p>While we were hoping to have our second auditor signed, sealed and announced by the end of this week, it has come to our attention that this will not be the case, and it is instead entirely likely that we will announce our second auditor in the latter half of next week.</p><p>One of the many reasons we gave Red4Sec the go-ahead to start their audit immediately upon completing negotiations and signing the documents was because we did not want to delay them as we got things sorted out with a second auditor. It appears as though that decision was more prescient than we realized, and we are very happy with the current rate at which Red4Sec is progressing through their audit. We will of course announce our second auditor as soon as is appropriate, following a signing of contracts.</p><p>While we have heard some of the questions regarding exact timelines as they relate to Red4Sec from the community, we cannot in good faith try to estimate how long or short an audit as comprehensive as theirs will take. We ask that the community continue to understand the necessity of not rushing security in this space, and we will continue to provide updates as they occur.</p><h3>Looking Forward</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/672/1*wAiO2PVy3ryQXbkodxCWIw.jpeg" /></figure><p>As you may have noticed, the list of upcoming events has been growing shorter and shorter, and now consists of only the <a href="https://www.cryptovalleyconference.com/">CryptoValley Conference</a> in Zug, Switzerland, June 20–22. This is because, in addition to the last days of development and the conference grind, we have also been looking to identify, approach, and lock-in conferences for the second half of the year.</p><p>Stay tuned, we hope to have a list of conferences for the rest of the year somewhat finalized by mid-June.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=63f206bd0641" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/consensus-conference-next-week-63f206bd0641">Consensus Conference Next Week!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Held at <a href="https://www.reedsmith.com/en/offices/new-york">Reed Smith LLP</a> in downtown Manhattan, the event was an intimate gathering of Family Office managers and other affiliated individuals, who saw presentations from projects both directly in the cryptocurrency space, as well as more adjacent to it. This included groups like <a href="https://www.ledgerwallet.com/">Ledger</a>, <a href="https://auroradao.com/">Aurora</a>, and <a href="http://www.blockchainstudies.org/">The Institute for Blockchain Studies</a>, among others.</p><p>QRL was first approached by DC Finance to participate (and ultimately, present) at the conference months ago, and between when we were approached and when the event occurred, the size and scope of the event itself had increased considerably. Given that we are a tech-first project, catching the eye of an organization as serious about investment and financial management as DCF was greatly vindicating for our promotional strategies thus far. Looking around the room, it was clear that there was a marked absence of projects promising the world — everyone assembled had a clear vision, and was at some stage of materially pursuing that vision. Moving forward in the industry, I would imagine this will increasingly be the case. Put simply, Hot air can take you far, but a solid foundation will take your farther — the fundamentals are ultimately what will win out over time.</p><p>My presentation was titled, “Hedging against the Black Swan: How to make your portfolio Quantum Resistant” and like most of the talks of the day was focused on a particular aspect of the industry (in my case, Quantum Resistance and the potential for a Black Swan event coming from Quantum Computers). This was the most directly investment-related presentation I have given yet to date, and it was refreshing in some ways to be able to address some of the market concerns surrounding the industry in general, and quantum resistance in particular, directly, as opposed to having to talk around the edges of the topic.</p><p>While I was ostensibly there to present, I never like to attend any sort of gathering without learning something. I was most interested in learning what the personal opinions of various Family Office managers were in relation to cryptocurrency. Obviously they did not all agree or have the exact same perspective, but a few themes emerged:</p><ul><li>Family Office principals are not yet well-enough educated on cryptocurrency in general, and the industry has done a poor job of reaching out to them meaningfully up to this point</li><li>Blockchain projects need to better understand the relationship between Family Offices and risk to better communicate with both principals and managers</li><li>While Family Offices do not have the same profit motives as other V.C. firms, they also usually have their family’s name attached to their dealings, and do not want to be tied to embarrassing failures</li><li>Family Office managers, by and large, already have some personal capital in cryptocurrency. It isn’t about convincing them of the industry, but rather packaging the industry in a way that they can then pass on to their principals confidently</li></ul><p>While many in the cryptocurrency space seem to perceive Family Offices as the vanguard of V.C. investment (which is partially true), what some fail to notice is that, historically, this has been the case not by coincidence, but rather because industries have made meaningful efforts to reach out and educate Family Office principals. Absent those efforts, Family Offices will continue to only dip a toe in around the edges of the industry without having the confidence to jump in with both feet.</p><p>The DC Finance event was wholly unlike any of the other conferences or expos that I have attended so far in this space, and it was an unparalleled opportunity to present to people that are not usually present at the typical cryptocurrency event. I am thoroughly grateful to DC Finance for inviting me, as it was both a pleasant and educational experience.</p><h3>What To Look Out For</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2018/">Consensus</a> in NYC May 14–16</li><li><a href="https://www.cryptovalleyconference.com/">CryptoValley Conference</a> in Zug, Switzerland June 20–22</li><li>We are also still generating our second half of 2018 Conference list, so look for more announcements in a few weeks as our schedule crystallizes</li></ul><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=b7fe8067d40d" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/reflecting-on-dc-finances-high-tech-family-office-meetings-b7fe8067d40d">Reflecting on DC Finance’s High Tech Family Office Meetings</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>TLDR: Red4Sec has begun our security audit, a tip-of-the-iceberg overview of our own code practices and bug bounties in the cryptocurrency space.</em></p><p><strong>Red4Sec</strong>, our first security auditor who also completed <a href="https://twitter.com/NEO_Blockchain/status/942640352707653632">the audit for NEO</a>, is not only <em>doing</em> our audit, <strong><em>but has already begun</em></strong>. Another auditing firm will be joining them shortly after working through the final stages of paperwork, stay tuned!</p><p>The successful completion of <em>both audits</em> will grant us the ability to reveal a final launch date for mainnet, along with announcing the inception of our bug bounty program.</p><p>As a small note, having not one, but <strong>two</strong> audits before the launch of mainnet is a <strong>rarity in the cryptocurrency space</strong> (and with some of the recent security breaches, it shows!) and, along with a to-be-launched bug bounty program, underscores our commitment and openness to being scrutinized.</p><p>The Quantum Resistant Ledger is at its core dedicated to ensuring security for all its users and secondary layer applications, both now and into the future. To achieve this level of Post Quantum security, there are several methods that are used.</p><h3>An overview: Refinement, Review &amp; Peer-review</h3><p>Creating a blockchain isn’t exactly putting together a wordpress blog.</p><p>Every piece of code needs to be written with a plethora of vulnerability vectors in mind. Code injection, broken authentication, memory leaks, security misconfiguration, cross site scripting, DDoS vectors, and sensitive data exposure are just a <em>very small</em> handful of the things to look out for — and can be very easy to miss for inexperienced developers (and sometimes even experienced ones).</p><p>The consequences can be dire to miss any of this. <a href="https://www.inc.com/will-yakowicz/cyberattacks-cost-companies-400-billion-each-year.html">Companies lose $400 billion to hackers each year</a>, and just this year, <a href="http://fortune.com/2018/01/31/coincheck-hack-how/">coincheck had a $530 million dollar heist</a>.</p><p>Cryptocurrency is the last space to launch an incomplete product to the public, given the stakes at play.</p><h4>Refinement: Code Analysis and CI</h4><p><strong>CircleCI</strong>: Allows us to release code by automating the build, test, and delivery process. This means at every code change and Pull Request, the deployment of an entire blockchain and having it run successfully is a requirement before it’s allowed to be committed to the code base.</p><p><strong>Codacy &amp; Codebeat:</strong> Allows us to a check on code complexity, security and coverage statistics. This helps to keep our code maintainable and readable for those wanting to review and take a deeper dive. A requirement for open source projects.</p><p><strong>Snyk: </strong>Takes care of the code we’re dependent on. This is arguably one of the first and easiest checks those looking to exploit your code look to. After a responsible disclosure takes place, there’s often proof-of-concept code to that can be run.</p><p>If a project still has an out of date dependency when this proof-of-concept code is released, this becomes a copy-and-paste endeavor.</p><h4>Code Coverage &amp; Test Suites</h4><p>If you have heard any of our developers speak, especially Juan or Adem, everything is about coverage and unit testing. Coverage, coverage, coverage.</p><p>Coverage (in programming) is the amount of code that’s executed when a test suite is executed.</p><p>The <strong>test suite</strong> runs the code against a set of test cases to maintain expected behaviours. This keeps consistency in the expectation that different components in a codebase (especially a P2P one) have.</p><p>Everytime a bug is found, replicated and fixed, part of this process is to add the replication part to the test suite so it doesn’t happen again.</p><h4>Integration Testing</h4><p>Integration testing is yet another phase of testing that takes all these disperse components, combines them and tests them as a group.</p><h4>Review &amp; Peer-review</h4><p>After all the automated and semi-automated checks, any non-trivial piece of code written by our poor overworked developers, is peer-reviewed by our other poor overworked developers.</p><h4>More</h4><p>There’s testing fork recovery, fuzzing the API, launching temporary MockNets and more. What was covered here is just the tip-of-the-iceberg for everything our codebase (and developers) are subjected to.</p><h3>Taking it a step further: External Audits</h3><p>External firms have even more of an incentive to find something (for the fame), as well have the ability to have fresh eyes on a codebase to see things in ways that may be unexpected.</p><h4>Red4Sec</h4><p>With clients like NEO and Ubiquiti Networks along with responsible disclosure (ie. reported vulnerabilities) for Google, BitDefender, Youtube, MySQL, and TenX, there’s no question Red4Sec means business.</p><p><em>As mentioned above, Red4Sec has already commenced on their audit with us.</em></p><h4>Mystery Auditor #2</h4><p>We are at the very final stages of negotiation with our second auditing firm, and will <em>announce something shortly</em>. Stay tuned!</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/910/1*sti3dCDxJO12cL5lkH_qBw.png" /></figure><h3>Taking it two steps further: Bug Bounty Program</h3><p>Finding critical vulnerabilities and bugs is an ongoing process, especially within a complex codebase spanning multiple code repositories and programming languages.</p><p>We recognise the importance of taking this process seriously by having <em>proactive </em>rather than <em>reactive </em>security measures. This is demonstrated by our commitment to testing, conducting internal audits and procuring qualified organisations and/or individuals to perform external audits.</p><p>The bug bounty program will expand upon this by incentivising ethical hackers (white hats) to perform responsible disclosure and allows the project to close security holes and fix vulnerabilities safely without service interruption.</p><h4>Security focused Bug bounty programs in the cryptocurrency space</h4><p>For the cryptocurrency (a blended word for cryptography and currency) industry being so ostensibly concerned with… well, cryptography, we were surprised at how <em>few </em>projects actually have bounty programs related to security, at any level.</p><p>Of the top 25 cryptocurrencies currently totaling a marketcap of ~$350 billion USD (according to coinmarketcap, 2018–04–27), less than half of them (9) had bounty programs that were related to security or bugs, and only 3 of those we considered up to our standards.</p><h4>Our own bug bounty program</h4><p>We are taking the best examples from these programs and compiling them to make one of the most comprehensive bug bounties in the cryptocurrency space. We hope our example will inspire other projects to be more comprehensive with their own bug bounty programs.</p><p>This will be launched in close proximity to the release of mainnet and will continue be one of the key elements in our ongoing commitment to security.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=439db9c94fd2" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/external-audits-bug-bounties-439db9c94fd2">External Audits &amp; Bug Bounties</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/622/1*pMBlDPgaIRwrJ9K6J_3xFg.png" /></figure><p><em>TL;DR — Blockchain Expo overview, standing out from the crowd, summarizing the presentation, next stops on the conference tour</em></p><p>This past week I joined Peter (Founder) and JP (Core Developer) in their home country of England for Blockchain Expo Global 2018. The event was held at the Olympia convention center. While the stereotype of London is one of poor weather, I found it to be quite pleasant, as my home city of Chicago had snow on the ground when I left it.</p><p>Blockchain Expo, being an Exposition (as the title implies) rather than a Conference, afforded us an entirely different platform to introduce ourselves to many in the Blockchain/Cryptocurrency space. Unlike conferences, such as APAC, Blockchain Expo used most of their space for the Exhibition Floor, with smaller stages around the exterior. This meant that most of the action and people were found on the main floor, and it was frequently shoulder-to-shoulder bodies in the aisles as people tried to push through, or alternately congregated around popular booths.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tZOQuphigYqiDlofmgmH_Q.jpeg" /><figcaption>The QRL Booth</figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of booths, ours stood out from many of those around us, as we did not have cluttered paragraphs of text that no one seemed interested in giving more than a cursory glance. Instead, our simple yet clear aesthetic served as the jumping off point for many constructive conversations throughout the Expo. Luke (Lead UI/UX Designer) should feel very proud that his designs for our booth were so well received.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YMmdCHII40QVWlwk8Ec5Pw.jpeg" /><figcaption>Our fearless leaders, before their morning tea</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to myself, both Peter and JP came in for the Expo. This was my first time meeting both of them in person, and I will be honest, I expected them to be taller (no reason, I think I just expect my bosses to tower over me). Lucky for me, both of them were entirely accommodating, reminding me to look right when crossing the street so as to avoid a “Stupid American Squashed by Truck” incident from occurring, for which I am thankful.</p><p>One of the nice things that was said to us by more than one person during the Expo was some variation on, “There are a lot of projects here that are hot air, it’s nice to talk to one of the few that are actually doing something” — while we know that our tech-first approach can sometimes seem slow in an industry that seemingly revolves around hype as much as Blockchain/Cryptocurrency, moments like this are a potent reminder that as time goes on, projects with an actual commitment to code and producing results will set themselves apart from the vaporware and all-talk-no-walk projects that may at times loom large in our space.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*E0arcsO_t0UdIOC9PH5_3g.jpeg" /></figure><p>On Day 2 of the Expo, I gave a short presentation on QRL and how we are securing our network in the face of Quantum Computing and all the threats it poses. Given that it was an Expo and not a Conference, the setting was a bit more informal, and as you may be able to tell from the image, attendees sat closer to the stage than might be the case at larger event spaces. This allowed for a more intimate space, and made it much easier to field questions at the end of the talk as I could hear the audience members easily.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AvCKPBkhcugnzUS_8Z9aRQ.jpeg" /><figcaption>Candid photo from the CCG interview</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to the presentation and running a booth, one of the opportunities we were afforded at Blockchain Expo was having a chance to give an interview to <a href="https://cryptocoingrowth.com/">Crypto Coin Growth</a> — they reached out to us over Twitter in the weeks leading up to the Expo, and we arranged to have them come by our booth for a short interview on the state of the project and our experiences with Token Migration.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F8kOkTsqTh30%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D8kOkTsqTh30&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F8kOkTsqTh30%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/3ae30d3b19da872ee0b2304cd5b37c75/href">https://medium.com/media/3ae30d3b19da872ee0b2304cd5b37c75/href</a></iframe><p>It was a great experience, and while the whole Exhibition Floor was quite loud, I think the audio came out alright. Somewhat surprisingly, a duo sporting a camera and microphone also approached the booth later on during the Expo and requested an on-the-spot interview. I gave them one, and hopefully it sees the light of day eventually.</p><p>Looking forward, we have only a few stops left on the first half of 2018’s Conference gauntlet. Our remaining stops are:</p><ul><li>DC Finance’s <a href="https://thenycmeetings.com/">The High Tech Family Office Meetings</a> in NYC April 25</li><li><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2018/">Consensus 2018</a> in NYC May 14–16</li><li><a href="https://www.cryptovalleyconference.com/">CryptoValley Conference</a> in Zug, Switzerland June 20–22</li></ul><h3>What To Look Out For</h3><p>Given how straight forward the DCF event is, there will not be a preview blog, just a wrap-up blog after the fact. Look for another blog outlining where we will be in the second half of the year in about 4–6 weeks. There has been a slight delay in writing and publishing some of the blogs we have had planned given how much travel has been going on lately, but after this week that should settle down some and we will resume a more regular blogging schedule.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=83055106aae0" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/reflecting-on-blockchain-expo-2018-83055106aae0">Reflecting on Blockchain Expo 2018</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>
