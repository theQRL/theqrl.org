Needless to say, it was met with a positive response, and a flurry of suggestions.</p><p>Those suggestions were appreciated, and Adem Bilican has been hard at work bringing most of those suggestions to materialization. Below are the results of his labours.</p><p><strong>Before we get into that, for those that can’t wait to get started, you can get the </strong><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/qrl-wallet/id1458620542?ls=1"><strong>iOS</strong></a><strong> or </strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.theqrl"><strong>Android</strong></a><strong> wallet at their respective stores.</strong></p><h3>Better wallet management</h3><p>Now you can set different names of wallets. Deleting a wallet has a better warning and asks for the PIN. Also corrected is the QR code generated on the wallet section.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qoBnBaKavGSo2wn9Qz3aLQ.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CbM90ui0EsEwp1FuR5X63w.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tnv16XferZFDDpkF66XT0g.png" /></figure><h3>More fine-tuned transactions</h3><p>You can now choose the OTS key index by just tapping the “OTS key index” in the send view. In addition to that the transaction details page has been refined to include more helpful information without having to view things in the external block explorer.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TjQLxily8fFyQwOqhmaU5A.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*iCyd8O1cnvyUaHCO-QDtJQ.png" /></figure><h3>New: Settings page</h3><p>A new settings page will allow you to change the node (and port) to connect to. If anything but the default node is selected, a small warning icon is presented next to the settings menu to let you know that you know you’re not connecting to the default node. If there’s connection issues a message will be displayed on the transaction list page.</p><p>You can also turn on or off PIN security depending on your circumstances (it’s generally suggested to leave it on if in doubt!). If turned on, the app will always ask for the PIN when the user switches back to the wallet or if the application is left idle for more than 15 seconds.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1Uo5llHN4nFq3hVRrjQe-w.png" /></figure><h3>Better login/create page</h3><p>It’s now possible to open an existing wallet with a mnemonic. Previously, only the hexseed was supported, now you can open up an existing wallet with either the mnemonic or hexseed. This can be accessed from the login / create page, which can in turn be found when you’re adding a new wallet from the wallet management screen.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*iYZWGa9wA7pqhuqBaMHj-A.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LRET8zMBLTeuoVkfTFJcRg.png" /></figure><h3>Other fixes</h3><ul><li>Date and Time are shown according to users’ general timezone preferences</li><li>Smoother and more responsive transitions between views</li><li>Additional UI/UX improvements</li></ul><h3>Version 3.0 and beyond</h3><p>With version 2.0 released, you may have some other feature request or change you’d like to see, or, you may have noticed that maybe your request didn’t make it into version 2.0.</p><p>First, check to see if your request isn’t already slated for version 3 and beyond by checking out github: <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/mobile-wallet/milestone/2">https://github.com/theQRL/mobile-wallet/milestone/2</a></p><p>If it’s not there, then feel free to make a request/bug report on the mobile wallet issues page: <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/mobile-wallet/issues/">https://github.com/theQRL/mobile-wallet/issues/</a></p><p>Finally, a big shoutout to the community members that graciously tested the mobile wallet, broke it, and made a bug report. Truly unsung heroes that don’t get thanked enough.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f854d95afbef" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/mobile-wallet-v2-0-f854d95afbef">Mobile Wallet v2.0</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Development Updates, Google Quantum Supremacy, New Exchange Listing, QRL Mobile Wallet 2.0 Coming Soon</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vOMa2YhCOF7NZlsLhvPTYA.png" /></figure><h3>Introduction</h3><p>This past week has seen developments both within the QRL project, as well as in the wider world of quantum computing. On the local front, we saw the listing on <a href="https://trade.biteeu.com/trades">QRL on Biteeu</a> (link to <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/new-exchange-listing-biteeu-3d00fd8fbedf">blog</a>). On the national/international stage, we saw <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b9bb4e54-dbc1-11e9-8f9b-77216ebe1f17">The Financial Times</a> initially break the story that Google has achieved Quantum Supremacy, which is easily the largest quantum computing advancement of 2019 so far. Finally, we are happy to announce a release date for our QRL Mobile Wallet 2.0</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OhNo_CFeqF8VKdMcG2hfwg.jpeg" /></figure><ul><li><strong>audits:</strong> x41 audit report uploaded to GitHub</li><li><strong>theqrl.org:</strong> Blog + New market for markets page</li></ul><h3>Google Quantum Supremacy</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/920/1*6hJ0kInd5b5zSSrvU--2Yw.jpeg" /><figcaption>Credit: Google</figcaption></figure><p>Reported this past Friday by <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/09/20/google-claims-quantum-supremacy/">Fortune</a>, last week a paper was published to NASA.gov before being taken down, which seemed to indicate that Google has achieved <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/09/20/what-is-quantum-supremacy/">quantum supremacy</a>. The stated reason for the paper’s being taken down was that it was accidentally published early before a fully scientific vetting could take place (this could take up to months in time). Assuming that the claims in the paper are validated, it will usher in a new era in quantum computing, and will serve as further evidence that it is potentially possible to scale quantum computing.</p><p>The implications for the blockchain space (as well as a more thorough write-up on the signficance of quantum supremacy) can be found in the <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/quantum-supremacy-and-the-case-for-quantum-security-today-in-blockchain-390fe55daab5">blog we published on this new when it broke</a>. To summarize, the advancement of quantum computing technology brings closer the date when the theoretical vulnerability of most blockchains in existence today, ECDSA public key cryptography, is able to be actively capitalized upon. Please go back and read the more in-depth blog if you are interested, it is full of information on the subject.</p><h3>New Exchange Listing — Biteeu</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mRFcim9GR1MdKrJG7jHuqw.png" /></figure><p>As we wrote in our <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/new-exchange-listing-biteeu-3d00fd8fbedf">blog last week</a>, we are happy to announce that QRL has been listed on another exchange — Biteeu. A partner of Bittrex, Biteeu is based in Estonia, and is a partner of Bittrex. You can go over to Biteeu and <a href="https://trade.biteeu.com/sign-up">sign up for an account</a> if you are interested.</p><h3>QRL Mobile Wallet 2.0 Coming Soon</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*odYhWFTGDzwwkGOs0qpkxQ.png" /></figure><p>As we have been stating in previous blogs, the QRL Mobile Wallet update is nearly upon us. This Wednesday, September 25th, the QRL Mobile Wallet 2.0 will be released. We are all very excited for the improvements coming along with this update. A summary of most of the improvements coming in 2.0:</p><ul><li>User can open existing wallet with mnemonic (only hexseed was supported so far)</li><li>User can choose the OTS key index, just tap the OTS key index in the send view</li><li>New settings page</li><li>User can change the node (and port) to connect to. If not connected to a specific node, a small warning icon is presented next to the Settings menu.</li><li>The user can turn on/off the PIN security. If turned on, the app will always ask for the PIN when the user switches back to the wallet</li><li>PIN is required if the user leaves the app for more than 15 seconds</li><li>Deleting a wallet has a better warning and asks for the PIN</li><li>User can give a name to the wallets</li><li>Corrected the QR code generated on the wallet section</li><li>Date and Time are shown according to users’ general timezone preferences</li><li>Additional UI/UX improvements</li></ul><p>We realize that, next to our block explorer, our mobile wallet is the most-used way for people to interact with the QRL blockchain. We are very happy to be bringing this update to iOS and Android phones later this week!</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=de2cb842e019" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-september-17-23-de2cb842e019">Last Week in QRL September 17–23</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Google has reportedly hit quantum supremacy. This is an overview of that, why it matters, and what this news means to blockchain and other systems.</h4><h3>Contents</h3><ul><li><a href="#b06d">Overview &amp; why it matters</a></li><li><a href="#3c36">What does this mean for blockchain? Modelling and risk assessment</a></li><li><a href="#53d0">What about the banks and the rest of the internet?</a></li><li><a href="#1cb8">The case for The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a></li></ul><h3>Overview</h3><p>Recently, news has broken out about Google reportedly hitting quantum supremacy.</p><p>This was first reported by the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b9bb4e54-dbc1-11e9-8f9b-77216ebe1f17">financial times</a>, who indicated that they’ve read a paper put on the NASA website before it was later taken down for unknown reasons. Since then, sites like <a href="https://gizmodo.com/google-says-its-achieved-quantum-supremacy-a-world-fir-1838299829">Gizmodo</a>, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/f/614416/google-researchers-have-reportedly-achieved-quantum-supremacy/">MIT Technology Review</a>, and <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/09/20/google-claims-quantum-supremacy/">Fortune</a> have covered the event with more easily on the horizon.</p><p>While we’ll have to wait for Google to comment before we can confirm this milestone, there is some merit as they’ve been at the verge of achieving quantum supremacy for the last year when Google collaborated with NASA in 2018 to help them prove quantum supremacy. It was speculated late last year (2018) that the results would be seen <em>within months</em>.</p><p>Quantum supremacy, while ominous sounding, is really just a term that describes the ability of quantum computing devices to solve some specific (often limited in scope) problem that classical computers practically cannot. It’s the precursor to quantum advantage, where the problems become useful <em>beyond</em> merely demonstrating that they can solve problems that classic computers practically cannot.</p><p>Being able to outperform tasks of a classical computer is a watershed moment for quantum computing history.</p><h3>What does this mean for blockchain?</h3><p>If you’re not up to date, most blockchains (including all in the top 5 on CMC) use Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) for public key cryptography. Using a quantum computer, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0301141">Shor’s algorithm</a> can be used to break ECDSA.</p><p>What this means is powerful enough quantum computers can derive the private key from the public key. So if an adversary gets your public key (and has access to a powerful enough quantum computer), then they can derive your private key, create a transaction, and empty your wallet.</p><p>As of June of 2018, it’s been c<a href="https://medium.com/@sashagnip/how-many-bitcoins-are-vulnerable-to-a-hypothetical-quantum-attack-3e59e4172e8">alculated that 36% of bitcoins reveal their public keys</a>. Further complicating the above matter, anytime you make a transaction, your public key is revealed to the network. At that point, if the quantum computer is fast enough, (or the network is congested, you pay a low tx fee, etc), a private key can be derived and a new transaction with a higher fee can be made which will process sooner, and empty your wallet.</p><p>More can be read in the paper “<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10377.pdf">quantum attacks on bitcoin, and how to protect against them</a>”.</p><p>While all of the above is <em>absolutely true</em>, it should also be noted that quantum supremacy isn’t going to break blockchain <em>today.</em> Despite this,<strong> we absolutely should be ready for one that can.</strong></p><h4>The nuance of risk</h4><p>As blockchain is a ledger of transactions entrusted by the soundness of cryptography, it’s of paramount importance to ensure that the cryptography backing it is secure.</p><p>Without that security, the blockchain as a system that can’t be trusted — and there would be no point using it. It doesn’t matter how great your UI is or how many transactions per second or what smart contract features you have, without a foundation of security there’s no blockchain as we know it today.</p><p>With this in mind, it’s generally well understood that under the assumption that quantum computers are going to continue to make progress, at some point blockchain developers will need to update the cryptographic portion of their blockchain to be quantum resistant.</p><p>How much time do they have? Well, there’s a lot of considerations to take place. Everything from the advancement of quantum computers to the time to select and implement the algorithm. <a href="https://medium.com/u/ad87280e1b3e">Allen Walters</a> laid out everything in his article that took <a href="https://medium.com/altcoin-magazine/an-addition-to-the-bitcoin-wiki-page-on-quantum-computing-and-moscas-theorem-of-risk-f2345e504bb4">Mosca’s Theorem Of Risk Determination and applied it to Blockchain</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uJYfTV46S1QNwc3byIFWWg.png" /></figure><p>Modified for brevity from the article</p><blockquote>v = Selection of signature scheme, proposal for implementation. There are no plug and play signature scheme to replace current schemes.</blockquote><blockquote>w = Reaching consensus and upgrading the nodes.</blockquote><blockquote>x = Migration period. Due to the decentralized nature of blockchain, this can only be done by the users themselves, since only they have the private key and thus only they have access to the coins.</blockquote><blockquote>y = Stagnant phase to minimize the risk of burning live funds. After the migration period there will be unmigrated coins. Eventually the decision will need to be made of what to do to those addresses which are still vulnerable.</blockquote><blockquote>z = The time we have until a quantum computer of a critical level has materialized</blockquote><blockquote>q = Margin we should deduct from z as a safe margin to compensate the blind spot caused by the fact that any assessment of the development curve of quantum computers is based on incomplete information. Additionally, q accounts for the fact that developments on other levels like algorithms improvements can contribute to a quicker reach of the moment a quantum computer can break the cryptography in question.</blockquote><blockquote>V, w, x, y, z, and q are all undetermined. V, w, x, y will need to be done for every single blockchain that is serious about risk determination personally. Since for none of these periods there is a substantiated period of time known, no serious risk determination can be done.</blockquote><p>The time we have until a quantum computer of a critical level has materialized (variable ‘z’ in the above formula) is different depending on who you ask. The paper referenced earlier, quantum attacks on bitcoin and how to protect against them, modeled earliest estimates to be 2027 (8 years from now).</p><p><a href="https://github.com/theqrl-community/QCcalc">QCCalc</a> is another model which can be run using Octave or Matlab and takes into consideration things like:</p><ul><li>yearly increase in qbits</li><li>yearly error rate improvement</li><li>yearly algorithmic improvement</li><li>required runtime</li><li>maximum acceptable risk</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KRD91ySRje6jMxOdy6zX4g.png" /><figcaption>Some possible assumptions and their output by the author of QCCalc</figcaption></figure><p>Outside of these models there’s predictions ranging from 2 to 30+ years, but it’s important to consider that <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/06/how-to-predict-the-future/588040/">humans are often comically bad at predicting events</a>.</p><p>It’s <em>also</em> worth noting that while these models try to predict the future often based on past historical behavior, quantum computing is in its infancy and is now in an arms race. There’s lots at stake here for nations and commercial enterprises:</p><ul><li>The <a href="https://faqq.info/quantum-computing-is-coming/#fn:USA">USA</a>, <a href="https://faqq.info/quantum-computing-is-coming/#fn:CHINA">China</a>, <a href="https://faqq.info/quantum-computing-is-coming/#fn:EU">EU</a> and other nation states are investing heavily into quantum computing.</li><li>Tech giants such as <a href="https://faqq.info/quantum-computing-is-coming/#fn:GOOGLE">Google</a>, <a href="https://faqq.info/quantum-computing-is-coming/#fn:IBM">IBM</a>, <a href="https://faqq.info/quantum-computing-is-coming/#fn:INTEL">Intel</a>, <a href="https://faqq.info/quantum-computing-is-coming/#fn:RIGETTI">Rigetti</a> and <a href="https://faqq.info/quantum-computing-is-coming/#fn:MICROSOFT">Microsoft</a> are all competing for market share.</li></ul><p>This makes being ready for what is known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory">black swan</a> event critical to critical systems.</p><h3>What about the banks and the rest of the internet?</h3><p>These are critical systems, but they’re also (mostly) centralized systems!</p><p>This means they don’t face some crucial issues decentralized blockchains do. They can centrally change their cryptography without compliance of their users and the whole process can be done behind user interface. Banks for example have your keys so can afford to upgrade their systems later without you noticing.</p><p>For websites and the internet at large, both servers and browsers will need to update to include post quantum security. However, it’s possible to safely deny users on older systems wanting to use insecure cryptographic methods. To add, organizations like Google and Cloudflare are hard at work ensuring our internet is safe:</p><ul><li><a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2016/07/experimenting-with-post-quantum.html">https://security.googleblog.com/2016/07/experimenting-with-post-quantum.html</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/towards-post-quantum-cryptography-in-tls/">https://blog.cloudflare.com/towards-post-quantum-cryptography-in-tls/</a></li></ul><h3>The case for the Quantum Resistant Ledger</h3><p>As we’ve found in creating our own blockchain, the process of making a blockchain quantum secure wasn’t merely matter of dropping in another signature scheme and opening a github repository.</p><p>We first needed to consult with experts in the field of post-quantum cryptography and begin work on the structure of our codebase, which was first released to github in 2016. It wasn’t until 2 years later did we release mainnet in 2018</p><p>Part of it is that time spent is because we’re pioneers in the field. This is the first time a project has used the eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS) in a blockchain project. While XMSS is recognized by NIST as being post-quantum secure due to its minimal security assumptions (hashes), it’s also stateful, which means it needs to be run in systems that keep state (like blockchain), but comes with some special design considerations.</p><p>Beyond that, post-quantum secure cryptography often has performance and size considerations when compared to the likes of ECDSA and we had to ensure our network design and nodes could handle the load.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*msfoieYeQjNDoXzYwrT1eg.png" /><figcaption>Taken from a previous blog of ours which looked at performance: <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/qrl-improvements-i-63813234ef23">https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/qrl-improvements-i-63813234ef23</a></figcaption></figure><p>The QRL also includes the possibility to upgrade signature schemes (XMSS, SPHINCS, + future) and cryptographic hash functions (SHA2_256, SHAKE_128, SHAKE256 etc), and indicate so through an address format. This brings forward the capability of being crypto-agile, something no blockchain should be without.</p><p>All of this is externally audited with 100% coverage between <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/red4sec-security-audit-concludes-a-summary-563ecfe04c75">red4sec</a> and <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/audits/blob/master/x41%20Audit%20Response.pdf">x41 D-sec</a>.</p><p>From this strong foundation built up a full <em>very user friendly</em> ecosystem</p><ul><li>Desktop (<a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrl-wallet/">Windows</a>, <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrl-wallet/">Mac</a>, <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrl-wallet/">Linux</a>)</li><li>Mobile (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/qrl-wallet/id1458620542?ls=1&amp;mt=8">iOS</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.theqrl">Android</a>)</li><li>Web (<a href="https://wallet.theqrl.org">wallet</a>, <a href="https://explorer.theqrl.org">explorer</a>)</li><li>Hardware wallet support with <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019184453">Ledger Nano S</a></li><li>Reusable addresses</li><li>On-chain message support (80 bytes)</li><li>PQ-notarisation support</li><li><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/qrl-and-keybase-84968003bca2">Keybase</a> ID integration</li></ul><p>Along with several methods to interact with the foundation to further expand the ecosystem.</p><ul><li><a href="https://api.theqrl.org/#qrl-api">QRL API</a>: Organized around GRPC which uses <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview">protocol buffers</a> for serializing structured data.

Recently, Proof-of-Stake has been discussed more internally, as have greater attempts to involve our passionate community, and we are nearing the release window for Mobile Wallet v2. Additionally, we are happy to announce that there is another exchange listing on the horizon (more on this below).</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fY_2YroVG0hzMHFJGjqCxA.png" /></figure><ul><li><strong>mobile-wallet:</strong> Preparing Release 2.0</li></ul><p>As a reminder, here is a general list of the features/changes coming to Mobile Wallet 2.0</p><ul><li>User can open existing wallet with mnemonic (only hexseed was supported so far)</li><li>User can choose the OTS key index, just tap the OTS key index in the send view</li><li>New settings page</li><li>User can change the node (and port) to connect to. If not connected to a specific node (we can decide which one, the default will be mainnet-*) a small warning icon is presented next to the Settings menu.</li><li>The user can turn on/off the PIN security.

In any technological endeavor, testing is important, but for a project our size, having a group of passionate beta testers who can look at our mobile wallet in various operating systems, screen sizes, etc helps us in our efforts to develop the best QRL ecosystem possible.</p><h3>New Exchange Listing Incoming</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/637/1*ezTHk5Wuv02yk94FZ8ckTg.jpeg" /></figure><p>While we usually use these blogs as an opportunity to review what has happened in the wide world of QRL over the past week, on occasion we will also look to the future. Given the priority of conversation that exchange listings have taken in our community of late, we thought it reasonable to let our users know that there is another exchange listing coming.</p><p>For obvious reasons, we cannot be explicit in the details at this time in terms of what exchange it is, and exactly when we will be listing. However, we did not want to remain entirely silent in the face of the continuing conversation regarding liquidity availability for our users. Look for a dedicated blog, as well as dedicated social posts, regarding this development once the listing day arrives.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ff1065770b7a" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-september-10-16-ff1065770b7a">Last Week in QRL September 10–16</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

We are also looking to deepen that coverage where and how it can serve the greater good. We are happy to announce that both of those ends are properly pursued with the listing of QRL on the Cryptofacil trading platform.</p><h3>What Is Cryptofacil?</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BvRPPTUfVpU5t8bt9je0Mg.png" /></figure><p>Cryptofacil is an exchange that is primarily targeted at the Latin American market. It’s name, Cryptofacil, means “easy crypto” in Spanish and Portugese, and the exchange aims to bring large numbers of digital assets to the Latin American and Caribbean markets.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Last Week in QRL August 20 — 26</h3><p><em>Development Updates, New Exchange Listing</em></p><h3>Introduction</h3><p>Over the course of last week, we saw QRL integrated into the CoinTiger trading platform. While we are still looking for more liquidity for our users, we are happy to have added another option at this time. We wrote a blog on it — you can check that out <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/cointiger-trading-is-live-today-ad65d741c3be">here</a>. This week was slightly lighter on development than most, as a few developers were out of town.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fJuyiylFc6FOZsiBPJg5-w.jpeg" /></figure><ul><li><strong>mobile-wallet:</strong> Beta release of v2</li><li><strong>theqrl.org: </strong>Search engine optimization — SEO</li></ul><h3>New Exchange Listing — CoinTiger</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8tI1WGxsPY-Xv3JW1zUD3Q.png" /></figure><p>CoinTiger is the latest exchange to list QRL, bringing the liquidity options for QRL users to <a href="https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-QRL">Bittrex</a>, <a href="https://upbit.com/exchange?code=CRIX.UPBIT.BTC-QRL">UpBit</a>, and <a href="https://www.cointiger.com/en-us/#/trade_pro?coin=qrl_btc">CoinTiger</a>. Deposits went live the 21st, Trading the 22nd, and Withdrawals on the 23rd. We want to assure users that we are not resting on our laurels — we are still looking for more liquidity options.</p><p>CoinTiger is based in Asia, and should afford users both within and outside of Asia a new opportunity to trade QRL should they desire. CoinTiger is a crypto-to-crypto exchange that offers pairs against their 3 base currencies — BTC, BitCNY, and USDT. Their website also comes in a variety of languages, including English, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Russian. We are excited to see what this additional market brings to the QRL ecosystem.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=142d9af2835f" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-august-20-26-142d9af2835f">Last Week in QRL August 20 — 26</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

As you can see on their <a href="https://medium.com/@cointiger/cointiger-will-list-quantum-resistant-ledger-qrl-at-16-00-on-22-8-2019-utc-8-100k-qrl-token-5335ad9816cf">Medium post</a> announcing the integration, and our <a href="https://twitter.com/QRLedger/status/1164458435330469888">subsequent tweet</a> at 8:00am UTC this morning, QRL is now live to be <a href="https://www.cointiger.com/en-us/#/trade_pro?coin=qrl_btc">traded on CoinTiger</a>. CoinTiger will be running a few promotions, including a trading competition, over the first week following the listing. You can find details on all that <a href="https://support.cointiger.one/hc/en-us/articles/360034680493-CoinTiger-Will-List-Quantum-Resistant-Ledger-QRL-at-16-00-on-22-8-2019-UTC-8-100K-QRL-Token-to-Give-Away-">here</a>.</p><p>Liquidity has always been seen by the QRL team as a necessary component for a healthy, functioning, low-friction ecosystem. We are also keenly aware that acquiring more liquidity options for our users has been one of the top discussed issues in our <a href="https://discord.gg/zbAJ9YV">Discord server</a>, as well as one of the top requested additions to the ecosystem across all our social media.</p><p>Speaking more generally, liquidity is a balancing act. If a given asset is available to be traded on many platforms, but those platforms themselves are largely distinct and unconnected from one another, then issues of low liquidity, an unrepresentative amount of volatility, and even arbitrage can occur. Conversely, to have all of one’s liquidity eggs in one basket may pool volume, but it obviously exposes an asset to the potential of having its liquidity massively affected should that singular exchange be hacked, or shut down. Even less extreme events, like if it were to change trading minimums, deposit/withdrawal minimums, and/or fee schedules can affect its trading environment.</p><p>We are all excited about this new liquidity opportunity for our users and would like to thank the CoinTiger team for its help in integration.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ad65d741c3be" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/cointiger-trading-is-live-today-ad65d741c3be">CoinTiger Trading is Live Today!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>
