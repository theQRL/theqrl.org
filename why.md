      <h1>Why QRL?</h1>
      <p>Popular cryptographic signature schemes (such as ECDSA) in the cryptocurrency space are vulnerable to a sufficiently powerful quantum computer running Shorâ€™s algorithm. QRL is directly addressing and building a solution for this inevitable threat to the security of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies.</p>

				<h2>The problem with current blockchains</h2>
				<h3>A look into the future</h3>
			</div>
			<p><strong>We never like to bet against the future.</strong> The advancement of quantum computing has unquestionably progressed at a non-linear rate. In other words, the current state of quantum computing would have been hard to predict just 5 years ago and nearly impossible to predict a decade ago. We believe that this trend will continue into the future, and therefore, that there is no time like the present to prepare.

				<h2>QRL and our solution</h2>
				<h3>Future proofing the blockchain</h3>
			</div>
			<p>QRL provides a blockchain that is resistant to both conventional and quantum computing attacks. </p>
			<p>Our blockchain utilizes the previously vetted and provably secure Extended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS) to ensure that our network is resistant to quantum computing attacks. We aim to secure our network against the inevitability of quantum computing and all that implies for the blockchain and cryptocurrency space.</p>
			<p>By utilizing an address format that allows us to change hash functions down the line if necessary, we have created a blockchain that is adaptable and secure both today and in the future.</p>
