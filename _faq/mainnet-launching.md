The launch of Mainnet has, from the outset, been at the mercy of two main factors - internal testing, and external auditing. Internal testing has to be completed on both the private testnet, and the public testnet. Once that is secure, we will submit our code for external auditing. Once the external audit has been passed, we are confident in our own internal testing protocols, and will schedule the exact release date of Mainnet.
