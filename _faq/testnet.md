Guide to get started with testnet: [https://github.com/theQRL/QRL/#qrl-testnet-instructions-for-alpha-testers](https://github.com/theQRL/QRL/#qrl-testnet-instructions-for-alpha-testers)

- Web-wallet: [https://wallet.theqrl.org](https://testnet-wallet.theqrl.org)
- QRL Explorer: [http://explorer.theqrl.org/](http://testnet-explorer.theqrl.org/) 

NOTE: If one of the above links does not work it is because we have updated Testnet but not our FAQ page yet. The updated links and information will be present in #alpha-testers. Thank you for your patience.
