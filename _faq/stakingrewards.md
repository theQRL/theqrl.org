We cannot directly estimate how much any given staking wallet would receive over any given amount of time. However, as we employ a directly-proportional model of staking rewards, we can say that you will be rewarded with approximately the same percentage of the incoming QRL as you own of the staking population for any given period of time.

For example (JUST AN EXAMPLE): If you stake 100 QRL, and there is 1,000 QRL total at stake across all staking wallets, then you own 10% of the funds at stake. For any given block during the period of time while you are staking, you will have a 10% chance to create the next valid block, and in turn gain the block reward.
