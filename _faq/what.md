The Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) is a first of its kind, future-proof post quantum value store and decentralized communication layer which tackles the threat Quantum Computing will pose to cryptocurrencies. 

This is backed by provably secure, peer-reviewed [XMSS](https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/484.pdf) (instead of 256-bit ECDSA) with a proof-of-work(POW) algorithm, Cryptonight v7, which will later be hard forked to Proof of Stake.

Also included is:

- A [web wallet](https://wallet.theqrl.org) to create tokens & send and receive Quanta.
- Desktop Apps (windows, mac, Linux)
- An [explorer](https://explorer.theqrl.org)
- gRPC with protobuf for a powerful API

Soon to be included is:
- Post Quantum Resistant Ephemeral messaging layer utilizing [Dilithium](https://pq-crystals.org/dilithium/) and [Kyber](https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/)
