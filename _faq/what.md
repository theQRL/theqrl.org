Right now QRL is trading as an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain while we develop the QRL blockchain. It will be exchanged at a ratio of 1:1 at mainnet. The process will be simple, easy, and articulated when it comes time.

Upon release of mainnet, the Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) will be a first of its kind, future-proof post quantum value store and decentralized communication layer which tackles the threat Quantum Computing will pose to cryptocurrencies. This is backed by provably secure, peer-reviewed XMSS (instead of 256-bit ECDSA) with a proof-of-work(POW) algorithm, Cryptonight, which will later be hard forked to a deferred POS in Q3 2018. 

Also included will be:

- A [webwallet](https://wallet.theqrl.org) for a no-batteries-needed experience to use (just a browser like MEW)
- Desktop Apps (windows, mac, linux)
- gRPC with protobuf for a powerful API
- Post Quantum Resistant Ephemeral messaging layer
