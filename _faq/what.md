The Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) is a first-of-its-kind, future-proof, post-quantum value store and decentralized communication layer which tackles the threat quantum computing will pose to cryptocurrencies.

This is backed by a provably secure, peer-reviewed [XMSS](https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/484.pdf) (instead of 256-bit ECDSA) with a Proof of Work (POW) algorithm,â€ŠCryptonight v7, which will later be hard forked to Proof of Stake.

Also included is:

- A [web wallet](https://wallet.theqrl.org) to create tokens & send and receive Quanta.
- Desktop Apps (windows, mac, Linux)
- An [explorer](https://explorer.theqrl.org)
- gRPC with protobuf for a powerful API

Soon to be included is:
- Post Quantum Resistant Ephemeral messaging layer utilizing [Dilithium](https://pq-crystals.org/dilithium/) and [Kyber](https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/)
