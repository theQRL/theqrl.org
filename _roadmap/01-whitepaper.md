After discussion with developers, post-quantum cryptographers, and research into the existing roadmaps of various blockchain technologies, the whitepaper was written to provide an overview of quantum resistant methodologies. The Winternitz OTS+ and Extended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS) were identified as the optimal solutions. This investigation also revealed the necessity of QRL to stand alone as a network with interoperability in the later pipeline.
