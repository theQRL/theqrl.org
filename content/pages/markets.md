> **Important Notice: QRL is NOT an ERC20 Token**
>
> Please be aware that QRL (Quantum Resistant Ledger) operates on its own independent blockchain and is not an ERC20 token on the Ethereum or any other network (Solana, Chainlink, etc).
>
> This independence is essential for QRL's quantum security. Tokens on these networks are inherently vulnerable to attacks from sufficiently powerful quantum computers, whereas QRL is designed to be safe from such threats.
>
> For projects exploring quantum-safe deployments, QRL’s next-generation platform, Zond, is currently in Testnet v1. Zond combines QRL’s quantum resistance with the versatility of Ethereum’s ecosystem, introducing EVM-compatible smart contracts for a more secure and flexible future.

## Other ways to acquire QRL

### Mining

QRL uses the CPU friendly RandomX Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm to mine and can be mined by setting [mining to a pool](https://docs.theqrl.org/mining/mining/)(easy) or setting up a [mining node](https://docs.theqrl.org/mining/full-node/)(advanced).

For extra mining power, some people like to rent extra hashrate from a service like [nicehash](https://nicehash.com/) and pointing that hashrate to a pool.

### The Discord #OTC (Over-the-counter) channel

You can head over to the Discord [#OTC](https://theqrl.org/discord) channel and put in a `wts` (want to sell) or `wtb` (want to buy) order.

### Participating in community lead events

We have frequent community lead puzzles and events in our [discord community](https://theqrl.org/discord) which often have rewards present.
