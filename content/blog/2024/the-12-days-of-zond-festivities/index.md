## Day 2: Compliment a community member!

{{< image "./images/day2.png" >}}

Welcome to Day 2 of the 12 Days of Zond! Today’s festivity is all about appreciating and celebrating the amazing members of the [QRL community](/discord). It’s a chance to recognize the unique values and contributions that make our community so special. 👏🎁

### What Is It?

Today’s activity is Discord-specific and revolves around showing appreciation for fellow members of the QRL community. Whether it’s their insightful comments, warm welcomes to newcomers, or consistent contributions, let’s tip our hats to the individuals who make our community thrive.

### How to Participate

**Step 1: Head to Discord**

- Go to the **#general-qrl** channel within our Discord community.

**Step 2: Think About Your Compliment**

Take a moment to think about a fellow community member who deserves recognition. Consider someone who:

- Regularly brings unique value or insights to the chat.
- Welcomes newcomers in a refreshing way.
- Or anyone else who’s made a positive impact!

**Step 3: Post Your Compliment**

- Publicly share your compliment in the #general-qrl channel with the following 3 pieces of info:
- @Mention the user (e.g., @JohnSmith).
- Write out your compliment (what they’ve done and why you appreciate them).

**Include the hashtag #12DaysOfZond**

- The most thoughtful compliments will be dually rewarded with a little bit of quanta (distribution depending on how many participate)

**Example Post**

To help inspire you, here’s a quality example:

- @JohnSmith I’m tipping my PQ digital hat to you. Since I’ve joined the community a few years ago, you’ve always made me feel welcome and less intimidated. Your help breaking down the technical specifics of the quantum threat into layman terms alongside the team’s QRL video content made me realize there are many others like me in the community. Keep doing your thing! #12DaysOfZond

**Not Yet a Community Member?**

This activity is geared toward current community members, but if you’re not yet part of the QRL family, join us in our [QRL Discord](/discord).

By joining, you’ll become part of a vibrant and diverse group of like-minded individuals — from PhDs and academics to retail investors and hardcore cryptographers. It’s a community like no other!

## Day 1: Post-Quantum Crossword Puzzle Festivity

> **Hint:** Still stuck on #5 "I Lov this word"? Might be time to use a quantum search algorithm or ask the person who devised it.

4. Reaching out to us on X/Twitter, Telegram, Discord, or Reddit:

## Guidelines and additional information

### Create a QRL Address

Creating a QRL address is simple.

1. Download a Wallet: Visit our [downloads](/downloads) page and choose the wallet that suits you best.
2. Create Your Wallet: Follow the instructions within the wallet application to set up your new wallet. 
3. Find Your QRL Address: Once your wallet is created, your QRL address will be displayed. It will always start with a "Q".

**Important Security Tip:**  Always back up your hexseed (a unique string of characters) or mnemonic phrase (a list of words). This ensures you can recover your wallet if something happens to your device. 

> Note: For the mobile wallet, there is a community lead wallet by [Volt Development](https://volt-development.com/) available on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.volt.qrlmobile) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/qrl-mobile/id6448219494) that has been preferable to many.
