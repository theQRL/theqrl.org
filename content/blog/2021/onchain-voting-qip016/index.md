## Extended guide

### Step 0: Make sure your funds are in the appropriate spot

If your funds are on an exchange, you'll need to remove them before November 2nd, 2021 or they wont get counted in the voting snapshot!

You'll need to [create your own wallet](/downloads). Once you do that, *verify* you can open your wallet by closing it and opening it again.

After that, send the funds from an exchange to your wallet.

### Step 1: Be familiar with the neutral, positive, and negative considerations

Head over to our [pre-vote synopsis](/blog/qip016-reduce-emission-rate-of-the-network-prevote-synopsis/) and read it for an overview.

Lots may have been discussed since then, so it's recommended to join the conversation happening in our [Discord](/discord) community.

### Step 2: Head over to vote.theqrl.org

On [vote.theqrl.org](https://vote.theqrl.org), you'll be presented by a page that outlines the voting parameters, voting options, progress, and a way to check the status of your vote.

### Step 3: Send the message transaction

With the hash outlined in the vote options on [vote.theqrl.org](https://vote.theqrl.org), open up your wallet at [wallet.theqrl.org](https://wallet.theqrl.org) and go to tools -> message transaction.

### Step 4: Verify that your vote was successful

Head back to [vote.theqrl.org](https://vote.theqrl.org) and go to the address check portion of the page. There you'll find a place to copy in your address to check to see whether your vote was counted.

### Step 5: Celebrate

Your vote has successfully been tallied into the fabric of time. It's possible people will look back on this day and see this as a historic moment in history that you were part of!

## How on-chain voting works with QRL

Votes using QRL's on-chain voting system are conducted by users sending a message transaction to the chain *after* the snapshot block-height is taken.  

This message transaction contains metadata generated by our voting platform at https://vote.theqrl.org specifying an identifier of the poll and the user's vote option.

### Vote parameters

You can see a quick overview our vote parameters in our [QIP016 errata blog](/blog/qip016-reduce-emission-rate-of-the-network-prevote-synopsis/#vote-parameters), but we're going to break them down here.

Officially, the source-of-truth for vote parameters for QIPs are 

- **Title:** The title of the vote. This is normally the same as the QIP title. 
- **Author:** The author of the vote proposal. This is the entity who spearheads the QIP. An entity will normally be one or more individuals, but could also be a group, such as an organisation. For QIP-016 that entity is 4d5a
- **Coordinator:** The organisation responsible for coordinating the vote. For QIPs this will be the QRL Foundation
- **Eligibility:** Specifies who can (or can't) vote and what parameters. 
- **Vote type:** Specifies the vote type.
- **Snapshot date:** The date a snapshot of address balances will be taken. After the snapshot is taken, and before the vote end date, votes can be submitted using the message transaction information found on https://vote.theqrl.org.
- **Voting end date:** The date the final records will be tallied and the votes counted.

## Frequently asked questions

### I have my funds on an exchange, can I vote?

You will need to take your funds **off** of an exchange before the snapshot blockheight.

### I have my funds on my mobile wallet, can I vote?

Yes, though you'll need to export your private key to vote.

### I have my funds on my ledger, can I vote?

Open your ledger from the desktop wallet like you normally would, and make a message transaction from the information found at https://vote.theqrl.org.

### What happens after the vote?

As per our QIP process, we'll be evaluating the outcome and make a public determination based on the votes and other considerations.

### How many votes are required for the Proposal to pass?

QIP voting parameters are evaluated on a case by case basis. As this is dealing with the economics of the QRL blockchain, greater than 50% of the eligible votes (where 1 QRL = 1 vote) are required to pass. 

For QIP 016, eligible votes are `circulating_population-exchanges-foundation`, or about `55.71m` QRL. Half of that would be roughly `27.85m` to pass. Of course, the final values are determined based on the blockheight the snapshot is made.
